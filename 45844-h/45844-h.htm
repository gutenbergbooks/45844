<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Persia</span> is mostly a tableland, from which
rise many high mountains. In the winter
come storms of snow and rain; in the spring
the ground is green with grass and bright
with many flowers; but in the late summer
and fall it is dry and hot. Over the mountains
wander the Kurds, who live in tents,
and drive with them the great flocks of
goats and sheep whose milk gives them
food and from whose wool they weave their
clothing and rugs. In many of the valleys
are villages. Here live the busy Persian
peasants, who have brought the water in
long channels from its bed in the valleys
to water their fields and orchards. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
plenty of water is found there are towns
and cities.</p>

<p>Over two thousand years ago the kings
of the Persians were the most powerful in
the world, and ruled all the country from
India to Europe. Some of them helped
the Jews, as is told in the books of Ezra and
Nehemiah in the Old Testament. Two of
them tried to conquer Greece, but the brave
Greeks defeated their armies in the famous
battles of Marathon and Salamis. Many
years later the Greeks themselves under
Alexander the Great invaded Persia and
won its empire. But the Persians afterwards
regained the power, and for five centuries
held their own against the armies of
the Roman emperors.</p>

<p>Suddenly great armies of Arabs poured
out from the wide desert land of Arabia,
eager to conquer the world, and to bring
others to accept the new religion taught by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
their prophet, Muhammad. Thousands of
them entered Persia. They induced the
Persians to forsake their own religion,
called fire worship, and to become Muhammadans.</p>

<p>Six hundred years passed, when new and
more terrible invaders spread over the land.
These were armies of horsemen armed with
bows, who came in thousands from the wide
plains of Siberia. They were the ancestors
of the Turks. They destroyed a great many
villages and cities, and killed tens of thousands
of the Persians. Even yet, after more
than five hundred years, one may see in
Persia ruins made by them. A great many
Turks still live in northern Persia.</p>

<p>The Persians are now a weak and ignorant
nation; but the most progressive of
them are trying to secure good schools and
to improve their country in other ways.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>KARIM ARRIVES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one in the house of Abdullah was
smiling on the day when a boy was born.
Even Ashak the donkey, as he was bringing
big bundles of wheat from the field, did
not get half as many pokes as usual from
the nail pointed stick that took the place of
a whip, and was actually let alone for a
whole afternoon to eat the dead grass and
crisp thistles by the roadside.</p>

<p>Old Bajee, who was caring for the baby,
ran as fast as she could to be the first to
tell the news to Abdullah, calling out all
the way, "Good news! a boy! a boy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Praise be to God!" exclaimed Abdullah,
and gave her a piece of silver money
worth half a dollar. Laughing from joy
she clutched this tight in her fist, and almost
touched the ground with her forehead
as she bowed to him. She had never owned
half a dollar at one time except twice before
in her life.</p>

<p>Abdullah hurried to the little shop
around the corner and bought a loaf of
sugar and some tea, and the tea urn, or
samovar, was soon steaming. His neighbours&mdash;all
men&mdash;came to congratulate
him. Some brought raisins as a present,
some melons. One brought another small
loaf of sugar.</p>

<p>"May his foot be blessed!" they said.
(They meant the baby's foot.) "This is
light to your eyes!" "May you be the
father of eight boys and no girls!"</p>

<p>Said Abdullah, "Praise be to God!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and gave them all small tumblers of tea
that was nearly boiling and as sweet as
sugar could make it.</p>

<p>Meantime the women were coming to
see the baby. Old Bajee had rubbed him
all over with salt; then she had tied a
dark handkerchief over his eyes and
wrapped him up in strips of cotton cloth
and a little quilt. He was now lying by
his mother. She was thinking about the
Evil Eye,&mdash;an evil spirit or fairy who
was always trying to do bad things,&mdash;and
looked anxiously at the baby's arm.</p>

<p>"Where is the charm, Bajee?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said a neighbour, "he needs a
charm at once, for he is so very pretty."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that," exclaimed the
mother; "the Evil Eye will hurt him if
you do. Bring the charm."</p>

<p>Bajee brought a piece of paper on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the mullah (or preacher) had written a
prayer asking the angels to keep the Evil
Eye away, and putting this in a tiny bag
she tied it to the baby's right arm. "That
prayer will frighten the Evil Eye," she
said.</p>

<p>All this seemed very interesting to Almas.
How delightful it was to have a baby
brother. She wondered why her uncle
Mashaddi had not seemed greatly pleased
when a baby girl had come to his house
two weeks before. No one had even called
to congratulate him. But now her father
was getting up a dinner party, and they
were roasting a whole lamb for it, and
cooking, oh! so many other delicious
things. She could smell the onions even
from the street, so she asked her grandmother
for something good.</p>

<p>Grandmother laughed and said, "The
front door cried for three days when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
were born. But God gave you to us, and
we are not sorry."</p>

<p>Then she gave Almas a big piece of
bread with rice and meat heaped upon it,
and some omelet mixed with molasses.</p>

<p>Meantime mother was sleeping with
baby by her side. Her last words had been,
"Bajee, be sure to keep the light burning,
so that the evil spirits will be afraid and
not get the baby."</p>

<p>When baby was just a week old, the
preacher, whom they called the mullah,
came to give him a name. He brought the
holy book which was their Bible, and
which they called the Koran. No one in
that village believed in Jesus Christ in the
way in which Christians do, but were in
religion what we call Muhammadans. The
mullah stood over the baby and read out of
this Koran in a loud, sing-song voice.</p>

<p>Baby was frightened, and cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The mullah did not stop, but next made
a long prayer in words which no one else
could understand, because he was speaking
in Arabic, the holy language which Muhammad,
the prophet who had composed
the Koran, had spoken. Then he called
out, "Your name is Karim!"</p>

<p>Almas thought it was quite a funny sight
to see his long red beard wagging back
and forth while he made such strange
sounds, and so she broke into a laugh, at
which her father turned and struck her.
She went out crying softly. She did not
like the mullah. Why had he come to
frighten baby? He had not named her
little cousin. Old Bajee had shouted in
her ear, "Your name is Fatima!" and
that was all.</p>

<p>After this Karim was laid in a very narrow
cradle without any sides, and long
strips of cloth were wrapped around and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
around him and under the bottom of the
cradle. His arms were tied down, and a
calico curtain kept the light out. He lay
in this dark little place nearly all the time
for the first six months, generally asleep.</p>

<p>Although Abdullah was very proud of
him, he hardly noticed him for over a
month, because the evil spirits would wonder
what he was looking at and come to
see.</p>

<p>Once a day baby's mother would build
the fire for cooking, and the room would
fill with smoke, because there was no chimney,
but only a hole in the middle of the
ceiling. At first he cried every time, for
the smoke made his eyes smart with pain.
His mother put some medicine upon them
when she saw how red they had become,
and asked Bajee what the matter was.</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" said Bajee. "Babies
always have sore eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>When the curtain was loose and it was
not too dark the flies came to visit him.
There seemed to be hundreds of them, and
they walked all over his face and even into
his mouth, but were especially fond of his
red eyes and gathered in black rows around
them. He winked and winked, but they
did not care. Then he would begin to cry.</p>

<p>After a while mother would come to fix
the curtain and rock the cradle, or perhaps&mdash;and
this was the best of all&mdash;she
would undo the wrappings and take him
in her arms for a few minutes, singing,
"My dear baby! my sweet baby! You
are my father! and the father of my
father!" She meant that she thought as
much of him as of her grandfather, and
every one always talked as if people cared
more for a grandfather than for any one
else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>KARIM'S RELATIVES AND HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Karim's mother, whom he was
now learning to call "Nana," said to
father Abdullah, "Master, your boy&mdash;may
his eyes have light!&mdash;is now five
months old, and ought to come out of his
cradle. Buy some calico, and I will make
another shirt for him. Do not buy red
or any bright colour, so that the Evil Eye
may not think him too pretty and so become
jealous and strike him."</p>

<p>She made the shirt so short that his fat
brown legs were bare to the knee.</p>

<p>When he could crawl around in the
house sister Almas watched him. It was
too dark for him to see much, for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
light came from the door, when that was
open, and from the hole, about a foot
square, in the middle of the ceiling, where
the smoke at last went out. The door
was so low that Nana had to stoop every
time she went through it. The walls
were black from the smoke, which Karim
now found poured out each morning from
a hole in the floor about as big as a large
barrel. Nana did the cooking with the
fire which she kept burning in this hole.</p>

<p>One afternoon Karim looked down, and
found that its bottom was all bright with
light which came from glowing red lumps.
It was the prettiest thing he had ever seen,
and he grasped the edge and leaned away
over to see still better. Just then Almas
screamed and jerked him back by his foot
so suddenly that the skin of his hands was
scratched by the rough edge. Of course
he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Nana came running in, and snatching
him up exclaimed between her sobs,
"Awý! my precious! he might have
fallen in!" Then she struck Almas, so
that she, too, cried.</p>

<p>After this Karim had to be satisfied
with the bright light shining in through
the hole above his head, and with the two
round trays which, leaning against the
wall, shone like polished silver until at last
the smoke darkened them. They remained
so until the next year, when a man came
from the city and polished them over
again.</p>

<p>In the daytime there were large piles of
bedclothes tightly rolled up near the
cradle. A few rugs lay folded beside
them. There were no tables or chairs or
bedsteads, and the floor was simply the
hard earth. In the corner were a few
green bowls, and some wooden spoons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
copper plates. These were the dishes for
the meals. Just across from the door stood
a wooden chest, half as high as the room.
This was where all the flour was put in
the autumn, when Abdullah had packed
it down carefully by stamping upon it
with his bare feet. Near it was a door
opening into darkness, through which
Karim was afraid to crawl.</p>

<p>When he tired of these things, he looked
at the chickens,&mdash;an old rooster dressed
in red and black, but without any tail (he
had never had any), and two or three
clucking old biddies in sober gray, besides
a half dozen others, hungry looking, half
grown, with long legs. Like the flies, they
came into the house whenever the door was
open. If Nana left any food standing even
for a minute she had to cover it. They
came at meal time as regularly as if they
had been invited, and fought with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
other for the scraps of bread or bits of
gristle that Abdullah threw away. Several
times the rooster snatched the piece of
bread which Karim was eating right out
of his hand; but when he laid the bread
down to crow for the biddies, one of the
half grown chickens caught it up and ran
around the room with it, chased by all of
his hungry brothers.</p>

<p>The family got up every morning when
it was just beginning to become light. All
but Karim were busy nearly the whole of
the day. When the sun was two or three
hours high&mdash;no one had a clock&mdash;Abdullah
came in for breakfast.</p>

<p>At meal time Nana brought the large
tray that took the place of a table, and
Abdullah set it upon the floor and laid
upon it two or three sheets of bread which
looked a good deal like brown paper,
and was as thick as heavy pasteboard. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was made of whole wheat flour and tasted
very good. Nana poured the soup out of
a small kettle into one of the green bowls.
Sometimes the soup was mixed with pieces
of meat and onions, and was red with pepper;
sometimes it was made of curded
milk and greens. There were also onions
and salted cheese and red peppers for side
dishes, with cucumbers and melons and
other fruits in summer.</p>

<p>Abdullah sat down on the floor upon
his heels and ate alone, until Karim was
old enough, when he always ate with
"Dada," as he called his father, while
Nana and Almas waited upon them. They
never dreamed of eating with Dada, for
that would have been very impolite, but
when he had finished they sat down and ate
what was left.</p>

<p>There were no knives and forks&mdash;what
were fingers made for?&mdash;and no plates or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
tumblers, for all ate out of the same bowl
and drank from the same water jug.</p>

<p>Between meals Nana was very busy.
First came the milking of the cow; then
the bedclothes must be rolled up and the
stable cleaned out, and there was sweeping
and churning to be done. The water must
be brought upon her back in a heavy jar
from the spring. In winter the cotton and
wool was spun into yarn and knit into
bright coloured socks, and in summer she
helped Abdullah gather the cotton or the
tobacco, and worked in the orchard or
wheat-field. In the fall she swept up the
leaves which fell from the trees growing
on the edges of the streams and carried
them home on her back to be stored for
kindling.</p>

<p>While Nana was working she usually
went barefoot. She had large black eyes,
and she made them bright by putting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
powder into them. She painted a black
streak across her eyebrows to make them
darker. Her black hair, hanging in long
braids down her back, was banged in
front, and was covered by a large handkerchief
which she wore all the time.
Very carefully, once a month, she dyed
her hair and coloured with red the tips of
her finger and toe nails.</p>

<p>Because she was careful about all these
things and was somewhat fleshy and had red
cheeks, her neighbours thought her beautiful;
that is, the women thought so. The
men hardly ever saw her face, because she
always drew something over it whenever
any man except Dada came near.</p>

<p>The men never asked him, "How is your
wife and little girl?" which would have
insulted him, but always said, "How is
your boy?" and sometimes, perhaps,
"How is the mother of your boy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Still Dada was really proud of her, but
of course he was careful not to let her see
it, "for," he said, "she is a woman, and
must be kept under." He seldom called
her by any sweet name, but when he wanted
to praise her called her simply "the mother
of Karim," and thought that, alone, was
enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>KARIM GOES EXPLORING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> pleasant weather Nana tied Karim
upon Almas' back and sent her out of doors
to carry him around. He was so fat that
her back often ached, yet when a woman
asked her if she was not tired she exclaimed,
"Why, of course not! He is my brother."
However, they were all so anxious to see
him walking that he soon became bow-legged.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="Girl carryng baby on back" />
<div class="caption">"HE WAS SO FAT THAT HER BACK OFTEN ACHED."</div>
</div>

<p>He now found what was to be seen out
of doors. The yard was small, and there
was no grass in it, nothing but the bare
earth. When it rained the cattle tramped
it into a deep black mud, which made a
splendid place to sit in and play. Across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the yard was the door of the stable, where
the donkey and the cow and two buffalos
lived with a few goats. In front was a
wall six feet high.</p>

<p>Just before the front door of the house
was a small porch, where the big dog and
the chickens spent the most of their time.
The calves came there, too, and the dog,
but he never dared to come into the
house. Nana explained that he was "unclean,"
and the mullah said that it was a
wicked thing to allow "unclean" animals
to come into the living rooms. Karim liked
to hit the dog, who always let him do just
what he wanted.</p>

<p>One day when Nana was away, suddenly
a fierce barking and snarling was
heard, mixed with shouts. Almas ran out
to find that a stranger had stepped into the
yard, and that the dog had caught him by
the ankle and would not let go, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the man was hitting hard with his heavy
walking stick. Almas was then only eight
years old, but she put her foot on the dog's
neck and raised her fist. The dog growled
angrily before he obeyed her and slunk
away. Some neighbours now came running
in.</p>

<p>"Did you not know better than to
enter a yard when no one was in sight?"
said they to the stranger.</p>

<p>Then Mashaddi had Almas cut off
some hairs from the shaggy neck of the
dog. He took these hairs into the house
and burned them, and brought the ashes
to the stranger, who seemed very grateful.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you, if God will, the wound
will heal very fast," he said, as he
sprinkled the ashes on it and wrapped
it around with an old piece of cloth.
"Not even a doctor could give me better
medicine than this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The cat was allowed to come into the
house, and was often there at dinner time
with the chickens. Sometimes Almas
petted her a little, and Nana threw her
some food once in a while, but even they
tried to hit her if she got in their way.
She spent the most of the day hiding
under the piles of fuel and in the dark
stable in the hay. The dogs were anxious
to chase her, and the boys were making
bets as to who could hit her oftenest.
Abbas was bragging because he had done
it twice, for she was hard to hit, because
she had practised dodging all of her life.</p>

<p>The door which opened into the dark
from the family living room led to the
store room. Karim often followed his
mother when she went in, holding a
lighted wax dip. There were no old
trunks with newspapers and letters, because
no one of the family had even seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a newspaper and no one but Dada had
ever learned to read. Instead, there were
big wooden shovels, plows, sickles and
a pickax. In the autumn grapes hung in
long clusters from the ceiling.</p>

<p>The baskets and jars were carefully covered,
but Nana used to open them for
Karim if he cried hard enough, and let
him feel and taste what was in them.
Most of the baskets were full of raisins.
Two held red peppers. Some jars held
salted cheese, and some were filled with
butter, which felt very cool and soft. The
pickled cucumbers tasted good, and best
of all was the molasses.</p>

<p>One day Nana had just taken the heavy
cover off from the molasses jar, when she
found that she had forgotten a dish. She
went out to get it, and Karim was left
alone. He pulled the molasses ladle out
of the jar and tried to get its bowl to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
his lips, all dripping as it was. It was
half as long as he, and somehow hit him
fairly in the eyes, filling them with
molasses instead of his mouth. He
screamed and ran through the door,
dropping the ladle as he went.</p>

<p>Nana ran quickly to Karim. "My
darling," she cried, "light of my eyes!
Did the molasses hurt my darling? We
shall beat the jug. See!" and she took
the broom and started for the store room.</p>

<p>Just then Almas appeared in the door.</p>

<p>"Why did you not watch Karim?"
Nana cried angrily. "We shall whip
you, too! See"&mdash;she added to Karim&mdash;"shall
we whip this naughty girl because
she let the molasses hurt you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Karim, picking up a stick,
"it was the jug. We shall whip it."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Nana, "how
kind he is to his sister."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Karim felt very much grown up as
he thrashed the jug, while Nana laughed
proudly because he showed so much
spirit, and Almas looked on with smiles
because it was the jug that was being
whipped, and not herself. The jug was
the only one that did not care.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE EVIL EYE STRIKES KARIM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Karim</span> at this time happened to have
only the shirt that he was wearing. He
had never had more than two at one
time, and one had dropped to pieces from
age the week before. Nana had not
found time as yet to finish a new one.
The shirt was a dirty brown, although if
one could have examined the seams he
would have found that it had once been
a dark red with black stripes. Now, with
the molasses streaks, it looked fairly
black.</p>

<p>Nana decided that it must be washed
at once, for Dada might not like to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his son looking so very dirty, so she
took him with her to the pool when she
went for water that morning. She washed
the shirt thoroughly, while he stood beside
her shivering in the cool breeze.
When at last it looked somewhat cleaner
she wrung the water from it as well as
she could, and put it back upon him to
dry. Karim fairly howled with cold as
he trotted along by her side, and when
they reached home, to comfort him, she
gave him two cucumbers and some of the
raisins that he liked so well.</p>

<p>That afternoon he began to cough
severely, and his head was very hot.
Nana pulled at her hair in her anxiety.</p>

<p>"The Evil Eye has struck him!" she
exclaimed. "The charm fell off from
his neck when I washed his shirt, and
I did not notice it for some time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Evil Eye must have struck him then.
Why did I not keep him dressed in
Fatima's clothes, so that the Evil Eye
would think him a girl, and not notice
him? or rub his face with ashes, so that
he would look ugly? Awý! What can
I do?"</p>

<p>"Get up," said Grandmother, "run to
the mullah, and have him write another
charm; perhaps it will frighten the Evil
Eye away."</p>

<p>Nana did so.</p>

<p>Said the mullah, as he gave her the roll
of paper, "If there are twenty evil spirits
in your son, they will all run away when
you tie this prayer around his neck. It is
worth fifty cents."</p>

<p>Nana began to cry. "What can I do,
O holy man?" she said, "I have only
twenty-seven cents, and my son will
die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take comfort, my daughter," replied
the mullah, "I am God's servant, and He
is merciful. The twenty-seven cents are
enough."</p>

<p>But that night Karim nearly choked
in his coughing. Dada looked very anxious.
"Women are donkeys," he said,
"and so are mullahs. I will go for the
barber."</p>

<p>The barber looked grave. "See the
black blood. I will take it out, and he
will get well." He cut a vein with his
razor, and caught the blood in a bowl,
but Karim became worse. The next morning
Dada hurried to the best doctor in
the village. He looked at the boy a
long time.</p>

<p>"Bring me this afternoon," he said,
"fifty cents, and that hen with a white
tail"&mdash;he pointed to the largest of the
old biddies&mdash;"and with its blood and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mouse's eye I will make a medicine which
will cure him. If it does not, take back
your money."</p>

<p>When he had gone Bajee and some
other women came to see Nana.</p>

<p>"My uncle once was sick like this,"
said Bajee, "and an old woman told
grandmother to take a rooster and cut it
in two, and tie the warm, bleeding pieces
upon his breast. That made him well."</p>

<p>"My brother," said an old woman,
"was cured of a cough by lying in the
oven for the whole of one morning."</p>

<p>So Karim spent the afternoon lying
upon the warm ashes in the hole where
the cooking was done, with the bleeding
body of the old rooster pressed tightly
against his chest, while the charms were
still about his neck and the doctor's medicine
at hand. That evening he was much
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Nana insisted that he was cured because
of the mullah's charm; Grandmother believed
in the dead rooster, while Dada
went to thank the doctor and give him a
lamb for a present.</p>

<p>It was some days before Karim was
himself again, and as he was fretful
his grandmother amused him with stories.</p>

<p>Here is one of them. The others were
very similar to this.</p>


<h3>THE FOX AND THE WOLF</h3>

<p>A fox started to travel to the city of
Mashad, because he knew that he was a
wicked fox, and such a good man was
buried in that city that simply visiting his
grave was enough to make one good. On
the way he met a wolf, who asked him
where he was going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>He replied, "I am a wicked fox and
am going to Mashad to be made good."</p>

<p>The wolf said, "I am very bad, too,
and ought to go there. Let me go with
you."</p>

<p>They went on together, and after a
while met a bear.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked,
and when they had told him he wished
to go with them.</p>

<p>As they made their journey they came
to a country where there was nothing to
eat. They all became very hungry; so
hungry that the fox and the bear dropped
behind, as the three were walking, and,
suddenly jumping upon the wolf when he
did not expect it, caught him with their
teeth in the neck and killed him. Then
they each took a part of the body and
began to eat. The bear ate until nothing
but bones was left, but the fox took some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of his meat while the bear was not looking
and hid it in a dark corner of a cave
near by.</p>

<p>After a while they both began to feel
hungry again, for the wolf had been so
lean that there was not much of a meal
to be made off of him. The fox went
into the corner of the cave where he had
hidden the meat, and soon the bear heard
him smacking his lips very loudly.</p>

<p>He was very much surprised, and asked,
"What can you have found to eat?"</p>

<p>"O bear," said the fox, "I was so
hungry that I have pulled out my left
eye, and am eating it, and you cannot
think how good it tastes."</p>

<p>"That is quite an idea!" said the bear,
and he pulled out his own left eye, and
ate it.</p>

<p>But he was soon very hungry again.
Then he heard the fox in the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
once more smacking his lips very loudly,
and he exclaimed, "What on earth can
you be eating now?"</p>

<p>"O bear," said the fox, "I was so
hungry that I pulled out my other eye
and am eating it."</p>

<p>"How smart the fox is to think of
such things!" thought the bear, and he
pulled out his own right eye and ate it.</p>

<p>Then the fox got a long pole, and
taking hold of one end he told the bear
that if he would take hold of the other
end he would lead him (since he was
blind) to a place where he would find
plenty to eat. But he led him to the
edge of a very high rock.</p>

<p>"O bear," he said, "there is a large,
fat sheep right in front of you. Now
jump!"</p>

<p>The bear jumped, and fell so hard
upon the stones below that it killed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Then the fox ate the body of the bear,
and it made him strong enough to go on
and reach Mashad, where he visited the
grave of the holy man and so was made
good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>KARIM AT WORK AND PLAY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village where Karim lived lay at
the mouth of a little valley. Down this
valley ran a stream of sparkling water
that came out of the ground about a quarter
of a mile above the village. This was
not a spring, but a "kareez," for beyond
it could be seen a long line of pits, joined
at the bottom by an underground channel,
through which the water ran. The road
lay by their side, and in two places the
path divided, a part passing on each side
of a pit.</p>

<p>Once while Karim lay flat on the
ground looking over the smooth sides at
the water trickling across the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the pit, he asked, "Doesn't any one ever
fall in?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i054.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="boy sitting on two oxen whil man holds plow" />
<div class="caption">"HERE KARIM SAT ALL DAY."</div>
</div>

<p>"Why should he?" replied Dada.
"Can't you see the hole plainly enough?"</p>

<p>"But suppose it was dark?"</p>

<p>"At night honest men are in bed,
and robbers know the roads. But if
God wills that a man shall fall in, why,
he will fall in, and cannot help himself.
It is Fate."</p>

<p>The stream ran down the valley past
an orchard of apricot and cherry trees.
By its side were willow trees, with short,
thick trunks, and a row of poplars, that
seemed to Karim the tallest trees he could
think of. Then it ran into the village
pond. Twice a week all the water was
let out of this pond, to be used in watering
the fields, but it soon filled up again.</p>

<p>When Karim was seven years old Dada
began to send him here with his cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Ali, to wash the two big black Indian
buffalos which he and Mashaddi used for
plowing. It was hard to say who enjoyed
it the most, the buffalos, who dearly loved
the water, or the boys, who rode upon
their broad backs, and splashed and swam
about during the warm summer evenings
as long as they pleased.</p>

<p>Dada soon gave Karim other work as
well. He took him to the field and lifted
him up upon the yoke between the buffalos.
Here Karim sat all day, to keep
the yoke by his weight from pressing
against the throats of the buffalos as they
slowly drew the plow back and forth
across the field.</p>

<p>Next Dada sent him to watch the cows
as they grazed in the open meadow in
the lowland, or among the dried grasses
on the hillside. Here he spent whole
days with the other boys, going swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and playing "marbles." For
marbles they used the bones from the
joints of sheep's legs.</p>

<p>The next year, in early summer, Dada
told him to keep the birds away from
the cherries and apricots in the little orchard,
by shouting and clapping two
boards together. At first this was great
fun, but he became very tired of it in
a few days, and his voice grew hoarse
and rough. Then came harvest time,
and he went out to the hot field and
carried water to the reapers, and rode
upon the straw cutter or swept up the
grain upon the smooth threshing floor
until he was so tired that he could hardly
stand.</p>

<p>About this time he fell sick again. His
head ached and he was hot with fever.
The doctor wrote a prayer with the blood
of a lamb, and Nana burned the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and poured the ashes into a cup of water
which she made Karim drink, but it did
no good. He lay on the floor on a thin
mattress dressed in his every-day, dirty
clothes, and the flies kept settling on his
eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>Nana and Grandmother were as kind
as they knew how to be. They took great
pains to get the tongue of a starling, for
a woman said that this would cure him,
but, instead, he became worse. At last
he broke out with the smallpox.</p>

<p>"All have the smallpox," said Grandmother,
when she saw this; "what can
we do?"</p>

<p>Some of the neighbours brought their
young children to see him. "They must
all have this sickness," was their reason,
"and it is best that they have it now, when
they are young." In this way Fatima
caught the disease, and died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Hers was a dreary little funeral. The
house was filled with the noise of the
sobs and wailing of her mother, who
was nearly frantic with grief, and with
the cries of a few of her friends. No one
thought of flowers, and there was no
music. As the funeral was that of a
girl, only three men walked behind the
body when Mashaddi carried it to the
grave. Of course no women went with
him, for that was not the custom.</p>

<p>Soon after Karim got over the smallpox
he began to go to school for a part
of the year. He was proud of this, because
a great many of the boys were too
poor to go to school. As for the girls,
of course people never sent them. What
would be the use? "Teach a girl! You
might as well try to teach a cat," they
thought.</p>

<p>The teacher was the mullah. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
first day of school he and his eight pupils
came to Karim's home to welcome him.
All were dressed better than usual. Karim
looked very gay in a brand new coat
of bright blue. Dada met the teacher
with a present of three chickens. Then
the boys marched to the school in a straggling
line, the teacher at the head, the
older boys chanting in a loud voice a song
they had been taught, and the three youngest
carrying the chickens dangling by the
legs.</p>

<p>The school house was the mosque, or
Muhammadan church. The room was
large and bare. Straw mats covered the
floor. There were no blackboards or
maps or desks; indeed, most of the boys
had never even seen a lead pencil. The
mullah sat upon his heels on a rug by the
window with a long stick in his hand.
The boys sat upon the mats, facing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must come to school before
breakfast," said the mullah. "If any one
eats any food before coming to his lessons
I shall pull out his ears."</p>

<p>If a boy was at all tardy he exclaimed,
"You silly animal, hah! Have you been
eating, and so are late?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed I did not eat anything!"</p>

<p>"Put out your tongue!"</p>

<p>Once Karim's breath smelled of onions,
and the mullah gave him so sharp a tap
that he felt it for an hour.</p>

<p>They studied a little arithmetic, but
spent most of the time learning to write
the Persian language, and to read from
the Koran. As the Koran was printed in
the Arabic language, which none of the
boys knew, at first they did not understand
what it meant, although the mullah explained
a great many things to them. It
was very important to learn to recite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
good many chapters from this holy book,
even if one could not understand what he
recited. No one could pray to God in a
way that was pleasing, the mullah said,
unless he repeated in his prayer parts of
these chapters, which the holy prophet
Muhammad long ago had brought down
from heaven.</p>

<p>Studying the Persian language was
more interesting work. In a short time
Karim was given stories to read which
told of the wonderful deeds of King Solomon,
who talked with the birds and made
the spirits of the air obey him. He also
read other interesting stories, very much
like those to be found in the "Arabian
Nights' Tales."</p>

<p>While they were studying the boys all
swayed their bodies forwards and back
and read from their books in a loud sing-song
tone. If a boy became tired he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
not dare to stop. Karim did so once, but
a stroke from the mullah's stick and his
question, "Son of a dog, why are you not
studying?" made him yell out with the
loudest.</p>

<p>He soon learned not to ask questions.
Once when there had been a slight earthquake
shock he asked what it was that
had made the earth shake.</p>

<p>"The ox," said the mullah, "which
holds up the earth upon his twenty-one
horns has become angry, and is shaking
his horns."</p>

<p>"What is he angry at?" asked Karim.</p>

<p>"God knows, and He has not told us,"
said the mullah.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the ox stands upon,"
added Karim, after a minute.</p>

<p>"If it were right for us to know God
would have told us," was the answer.
"Such questions are irreverent, and fools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ask them. Pray to God to forgive you,
and then begin your study again."</p>

<p>When Karim was eleven years old Almas
was married. The friends of the
bridegroom came to the house, and were
given a good dinner. Almas was so
bundled up that no one could recognize
her. Then they put her on a horse, and
in a noisy procession led her off to her
new home. She now lived in a village
ten miles away, and Karim saw her only
two or three times a year. He missed his
sister for a long time, because she had always
waited upon him so carefully.</p>

<p>As the wedding occurred a little before
the great festival of "Norooz," that
helped him forget his loss. "Norooz,"
or the festival for the new year, came in
the early spring, when everyone was glad
that winter had gone. Mashaddi said
that the world came to life then. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
days before the festival Karim's head was
shaved, and the nails of his fingers and
toes were coloured red. He was given a
new suit of clothes exactly like Dada's in
cut, and when dressed in them looked like
a little old man. "But then," said Nana,
"he is almost grown up now, and ought
to look so."</p>

<p>She arranged plates full of nuts, raisins,
dried apricots, quinces, figs, dates and
candy (there must be seven kinds of food,
and their names must each begin with an
S) and Karim took these as presents to
the mullah and to a few other friends.
Dada bought some sugar, tea, tobacco and
candy, and all was ready.</p>

<p>The festival lasted for a week. On the
first day Dada and Karim (now that he
was old enough) sat upon their heels in
the room to receive callers. Each caller,
as he entered, bowed low and said, "Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be to you! May the festival be a happy
one."</p>

<p>"May you be fortunate," replied Dada.</p>

<p>"How is your health?" asked the
caller.</p>

<p>"Praise be to God, we are well."</p>

<p>Then, sitting down, they talked together,
and took turns smoking from the
water-pipe. After the third cup of tea
had been served the caller rose and said
good-bye.</p>

<p>The greatest fun was on Tuesday evening,
when the roofs of the village were
alight with blazing pin wheels, Roman
candles, small volcanoes and rockets.</p>

<p>Children's Day was also a lively time.
Several of the young men of the village
dressed up as clowns. They had some
musicians with cymbals with them, and
went about saying and doing absurd
things. Karim and his school mates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
dressed themselves up like robbers, with
beards made of cotton, and canes for
spears, and went to the mullah's house.</p>



<p>"Give us some money, or we will rob
you!" they shouted.</p>

<p>He laughed, and gave them enough to
buy a plenty of candy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>A TRIP TO THE CITY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Dada said, "Shahbaz has
just come from the city, and says that
they are paying twenty-five shahis a batman
for wheat. If God is willing, I and
Karim will get Hussain's donkeys, and
take in our wheat to sell to-morrow."</p>

<p>Early next morning each donkey was
loaded with two of the black sacks of
wheat, excepting one donkey, which was
saddled and carried two empty jars, for
Dada intended to buy some molasses in the
city. To the saddle was fastened a jug of
water and a red handkerchief filled with
bread and cheese. None of the animals
had on a bridle. Dada and Karim started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
very early, going as fast as one could
walk, and taking turns at riding the saddled
donkey.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i0072.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="man driving donkeys while boy rides" />
<div class="caption">"THE SUN ROSE WHEN THEY WERE HALF WAY OVER."</div>
</div>

<p>The road lay over a dry and sandy
plain six miles wide, which it took nearly
three hours to cross. The sun rose when
they were half way over, and soon there
was only the deep blue sky and blazing
sun above, and the hot, parched ground,
with bare, rugged mountains in the distance.
The only green place in sight was
that made by the trees around their own
village, now looking like a dark band
against the yellow hills.</p>

<p>Karim looked back later, and was astonished
to see what appeared like a large
lake, bordered by many trees, instead of
the village and the plain. He called to
Dada, who hardly looked around, but
said, "The evil spirits do this to deceive
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, for an hour more, they climbed
a slope up the mountain-side. It was
tiresome work, and Dada had to grunt
"uh! uh!" at the donkeys harder than
ever, and prod them with the nail pointed
stick. A few stunted bushes were growing
among the bare rocks and thirsty gullies.
One small tree was passed, half covered
by tattered bits of cloth tied to its
branches.</p>

<p>Dada carefully tore off a faded strip
from his ragged coat, and fastened it to
a twig. "There is no water," he said,
"and yet this tree is always green. It
is a spirit who does this. Let us give him
an offering of respect." Karim felt afraid,
and did the same.</p>

<p>At last they went down a steep slope into
a valley. Here was a spring of cold
water. Around it were willow trees, and
near by melon and cucumber patches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
an orchard of mulberries and apricots.
They unloaded the donkeys and for a
shahi bought a melon from the man who
was in charge. They then untied the
handkerchief and sat down on the ground
to eat. After the meal they stretched
themselves at full length under the trees,
and were lulled to sleep by the deep
"boom, boom" of the bells that swung
from the necks of some camels who had
just passed with their heavy loads.</p>

<p>In an hour Dada waked Karim and
they started again. Soon the road grew
wider. All of the streams were now
spanned by bridges, while on every side
were vineyards and orchards. They met
many people, and many droves of donkeys,
and at last entered a long avenue bordered
by willow trees. At its end was the gate
of the city.</p>

<p>In front of the gate the road crossed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ditch forty feet wide and in some places
half full of water covered with a thick
green scum, where the frogs were singing
cheerily. Behind this was a wall, half in
ruins, with broken down towers here and
there. Inside the city gate the street was
about fifteen feet wide, and one could not
see anything on either side except high
walls of dried earth, with here and there
a gate or a narrow alley. There was a
narrow sidewalk, but people did not seem
to care much whether they used it or
walked in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had passed more
donkeys than there were in the whole of
their village. Some carried baskets of
grapes, some looked like moving piles of
yellow straw, and a few were loaded with
dripping lumps of ice carried in black
bags. Some were dragging poles whose
ends were for ever getting under one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
feet. One had a dead sheep strapped to
its back. These were small, mouse coloured,
half starved donkeys, like the one
on which Karim had been riding, without
any ambition or pride, but jogging along
because their drivers would prod them if
they stopped. They passed a few larger
donkeys as well, with handsome saddles,
ridden by well dressed men in long brown
robes and white turbans, who were mullahs,
or by women who were so bundled
up that one could not see even their
eyes.</p>

<p>In a corner was a group of beggars sitting
in the dirt, dressed in rags. Some
of them were holding up the stumps of
their arms, or pointing to their blinded
eyes.</p>

<p>"Give me money for food!" was their
cry. "May God bless your sons! For
the Prophet's sake, give me a shahi!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a pitiful sight, yet very few paid
any attention to them.</p>

<p>At a turn of the crooked street Karim
and Dada came upon three shops. The
goods of one were spread upon a platform
next to the sidewalk, and the shopkeeper
sat upon his heels behind within reach of
everything. Dead sheep were hung up
by their legs before another shop, and a
dead ox was lying upon the sidewalk upon
its own hide, spread flat on the ground.
At the third a blacksmith was shoeing
a horse, and everyone had to dodge by
with an eye upon the horse's heels.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty people were gathered
around a man with long, uncombed hair
and fierce, wild eyes who carried a small
ax in his hand, and was waving it about
and talking loudly in a singsong tone,
while a boy was going around with a
carved cocoanut shell, asking for shahis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Dada said that he was a "darvish" or
holy man who was telling stories about
the saints.</p>

<p>Suddenly two horsemen appeared,
shouting, "Khabardar! Khabardar!"</p>

<p>The blacksmith dropped the shoe and
gave the horse a blow that sent him
against the wall, and the holy man with
his audience spread in a row along the
side of the street. Dada in a great hurry
crowded the donkeys down one of the
alleys. They were none too soon, for almost
at once a large crowd of blue coated
horsemen armed with guns turned the
corner. Their horses pranced and snorted,
while the men cursed some of the people
because they could not squeeze themselves
flatter against the wall. One of them
struck a man, who did not even say a
word in return.</p>

<p>And now there came something more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wonderful than even Karim's grandfather
had "seen in a dream," as he told Nana
later. It was drawn by two spirited
horses, which no one was riding, but a
man held them back by long straps, and
they went wherever he guided them. The
thing itself was a great box of polished
black colour, with a door, and with soft
cushioned seats inside, upon which were
sitting two splendidly dressed men. This
box was carried on wheels that seemed
much too light to support it, and which
made no noise at all as they went around.
The only wheels Karim had ever seen
before had no spokes, and were each almost
as heavy as a man, and creaked so
that they could be heard a quarter of a
mile away. He was so astonished that
he did not notice that every one bowed
low until he felt a sharp blow from behind,
and a "Bow low, you fool!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he bobbed so quickly that his hat
rolled off into the road. No one moved
to get it, and in silent misery he watched
one of the horses crush it. It was a new
hat, and Dada bought him only one new
hat each year.</p>

<p>When the horsemen had all passed he
picked the hat up. There was a hole in
the soft crown, and it was stained with
mud. As he was wiping it off Dada came
up, so angry that he struck him with his
stick. Some boys who saw this laughed
at him. Dada did not comfort him at all,
but exclaimed, "I have a fool for a son!
Why do you stand gaping like a donkey
at the wagon of the governor? If that
man had not made you bow to the governor,
and to the prince riding with him,
some of the horsemen might have noticed
it. Then we both would have been seized,
and probably beaten. All my wheat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
would have been taken from me, and perhaps
I would have had to pay some money
to keep from being put into prison."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>KARIM'S RELIGION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> Karim went to the mosque
with Dada in the early morning on Friday.</p>

<p>The mullah had told him, "The
prophet Muhammad has advised that
every one should bathe on Friday and
then come on foot to the mosque to
prayers, and be reverent during the
service. God will give a great reward to
the person who does this."</p>

<p>The mosque was a plain building, with
one large room and a porch in front.
The room was bare, except for a few
mats and a small pulpit. When any one
entered he took off his shoes as a mark
of respect, but kept on his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>During the service those present repeated
aloud with the mullah prayers and
chapters from the Koran. Then the mullah
preached a short sermon.</p>

<p>The mullah got up early every morning
in the week and went upon the roof of
the mosque. Here, as the day was breaking,
in a very loud and musical voice he
chanted the "Call to Prayer." This was
in the Arabic language, so that Karim for
a long time did not know what it meant,
although he had heard it so often that
he could repeat most of it by heart.</p>

<p>But at school he learned that it meant,
"God is most great! God is most great!
I declare that there is no God but God,
and that Muhammad is the messenger of
God. Come to prayer! Come to the
refuge! God is most great! Prayer is
better than sleep. God is most great!"</p>

<p>In school Karim had also been taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the Creed, "I testify that there is no God
but God. I testify that Muhammad is
the prophet of God, and that Ali is the
ruler appointed by God."</p>

<p>Although he had been taught these
things, the mullah said that he was still a
boy, and that boys were not expected to do
all that God commanded. But when
Karim was thirteen years old the mullah
said, "You have reached the age when the
Recording Angel begins to write down in
his book whatever you do, whether it is
good or bad, so you must begin carefully to
perform good deeds, that they may help
to save you from the evil deeds you will
do, and thus permit you to enter heaven.
I have taught you the prayers that you
ought to say each day, and the way in
which you must wash yourself before
saying them."</p>

<p>Karim felt quite proud to be thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
so old, and began to copy Abdullah, who
was more careful about his prayers than
many of his neighbours. Abdullah bought
for his son a little rug and a bit of dried
clay that came from the holy city Mecca,
where the prophet Muhammad had lived.
Each morning, at the time of the Call,
Karim repeated his prayers, standing, and
kneeling just as Dada did, and touching
his forehead to the bit of clay when he
bowed.</p>

<p>Somewhat later came the month of
Ramadan. During this month it was
against the law for him to eat or drink
anything, or even to smoke a pipe, from
dawn until late in the evening. Of course
it was very hard to obey this rule, but it
was thought wicked to disobey it. What
made it harder was that Karim had to
work during the morning. In the afternoon
he slept some, and longed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sun to set. As soon as he heard the crack
of the gun that announced the time when
it was right to take food he hurried into
the house. Here was a good meal, all
steaming hot, prepared by Nana. How
they all did eat!</p>

<p>Dada always sent some of the food to
Bajee, the poor widowed woman who
lived down the street. Whenever a beggar
appeared, he fed him, too.</p>

<p>"We must give alms," he said, "if we
wish to enter heaven, for our holy prophet
has so commanded."</p>

<p>At the close of the month came the
great Week of Mourning, or Muharrem.
When Karim was still a little boy Nana
had taken him with her to the mosque
each day during this week. They had
sat outside in the street and listened to the
mullah as he told the sacred story of the
death of the holy Husain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>He explained how the rightful ruler
had been Ali, after the death of the
prophet Muhammad, long ago, because
Ali was the prophet's son-in-law, having
married his daughter Fatima. But
wicked men had made Umar the ruler
instead of Ali, and even yet the people
of Turkey, and the Turkmans, and many
who lived in India and Africa believed
that Umar was a holy man. When Ali
died his sons Hassan and Husain should
have become rulers. Hassan soon died;
the men of the city Kufa then promised to
honour Husain if he should come to them.
Husain believed them, and came from the
city Mecca with his family, guarded only
by a few warriors. But when he came near
Kufa no one came to help him. Instead,
the wicked governors of that city actually
dared to come out with a great many soldiers
and attack him, although he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
grandson of the prophet Muhammad.
The men with Husain were too few to conquer,
yet he did not surrender, because he
was the grandson of the prophet and the
rightful ruler, and none of his warriors ran
away, but together they died fighting
bravely against their wicked enemies.</p>

<p>As the mullah told in his sermons how
Husain was killed, first some women began
to moan, and later all burst into loud
sobs, while the tears streamed down their
faces. The most devout caught these
tears in little long necked bottles, to keep
them for medicine.</p>

<p>"God is pleased with us because we
weep for Husain," Nana explained, "and
because of our tears for Husain He gives
us all the good things that come to us during
the year. And the mullah says that
if we weep for our lord Husain the martyr
God will take away all our sins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the cities," added Dada, "they
have processions in memory of our lord
Husain."</p>

<p>"I saw the processions in the city last
year," broke in Mashaddi. "They were
wonderful. First came men bearing the
two black banners of the mosque. Then
followed others playing funeral music on
drums and fifes. After them walked the
mullahs and holy men. Then came a
long line of men and boys, marching two
by two. They were beating their breasts
in time with the music, and chanting a
dirge that was so strangely stirring and
yet so full of tears that I can never forget
it. Indeed, I found myself running out
to join the marchers, while my eyes were
blinded with weeping. There were two
little girls and a woman on horseback,
with straw on their heads and collars of
wood on their necks. They represented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you know, the wife and children of Husain,
who were captured by his enemies
when he had been killed. Boys walked
alongside, throwing straw into the air.
The woman's collar represented iron fetters,
and the straw was a sign of grief.</p>

<p>"In some of the other processions there
were men beating their breasts with chains,
and crying out as they marched, 'Awý!
Hassán! Awý! Husaín!' After them
came some men with white cloths spread
over their shoulders. They carried swords
in their hands, and as they marched they
cut their faces so that the blood ran
down."</p>

<p>"Why did they cut themselves?" asked
Karim.</p>

<p>"Because it is a very holy thing to do,"
replied Dada, "almost as holy as to visit
the grave of our lord Husain at the city
Kerbella."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw a boy on horseback," continued
Mashaddi, "with a dagger in his hand,
and his face was bloody from the cuts he
was giving himself. How they can do it
I cannot see. God gives them the power
to forget their pain. Sometimes friends
walk alongside with sticks in their hands
to dull the blows, and so keep them from
injuring themselves too much. But they
say that if a man dies from his cuts God
takes him straight to heaven."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>KARIM'S GOOD FORTUNE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Dada asked Karim,
"How would you like to travel, as Mashaddi
did, who was once a soldier of the
Shah, and was blessed by a visit to the
sacred shrine of the holy Imam Reza
when the Shah sent his regiment to
Mashad to frighten the Turkmans.
Wouldn't you like to be called 'Mashaddi,'
too?"</p>

<p>"It would be splendid," replied Karim.
"Only yesterday Mashaddi was
telling me about this shrine. The room
inside is just covered with gold and silver
and bright stones, and splendid rugs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
blessings the Imam gives to those who
visit it cannot be counted.</p>

<p>"But the mullah says that the tomb of
the Imam's sister, Fatima, in the city Kum
is almost as holy, and it is much nearer.
The dome of its roof is covered with
flashing gold, and inside is a silver gate,
with tiles of such beautiful colours that
he can't describe them. And Mashaddi
has seen the palace of the Shah at Teheran,
too. He says that he saw a throne
covered over with carved gold, and everywhere
in this gold are set flashing emeralds
and rubies and other precious stones.
Mashaddi called it the 'Peacock Throne,'
and said that the great Nadir Shah
brought it from India when he went to
that country with an army to fight the
Great Mogul!</p>

<p>"But I cannot travel,&mdash;the Shah isn't
asking for soldiers now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is so," said Dada. "But the
mullah has taught you how to behave before
khans (noblemen). Our agha (master)
is coming here in a few weeks, and I
am going to take you to call upon him."</p>

<p>"Our agha is a kind master," broke in
Nana. "It happened the last time he
came that he passed Abbas' field when he
was tying up the sheaves. Of course Abbas
hurried to put a sheaf in the road
before him as a present. The agha threw
two silver coins into the sheaf for Abbas!
That is a good deal better than the copper
shahis one usually gets."</p>

<p>"He is a just man," added Dada. "He
doesn't eat up all that the poor have, like
the master of Hissar. The people there
can never pay all that man wants, especially
since the poor harvest seven years
ago. That man had his servants put some
wheat in each house. Of course the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cooked and ate it&mdash;poor things, they
were hungry. Then he told them that
because they had eaten up his wheat they
owed him money for it. The interest they
pay each year is one fifth of what they
owe. But he cannot get it from most of
them, although his ferashes (officers) have
thrashed the men so that they went limping
about for two weeks. Our agha takes
only what is due, one tenth of the crop,
and his servants don't take very much,
either. Ahmad was the only man he had
bastinadoed last year, and Ahmad was trying
to cheat him. He said that he had no
money, when really he did have some
buried in a bowl in a corner of his
house."</p>

<p>"They say that our agha may even
become the governor," added Shahbaz,
who had just come in. "I heard in the
city last week that the Shah had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
him the title 'The Good Fortune of the
State.'"</p>

<p>"May God so will!" said Dada. "He
will be as good a governor as Rashid
Khan, the 'Glory of the King's Court.'
When he was governor a woman could
walk safely from here to the city with a
purse full of gold in her hand. I remember
that once I saw the heads of two
thieves stuck on the tops of poles before
his house. He cut off the hands of a lot
of rascals, too. But it isn't so now. Only
last week some Kurds stole five cows from
the herd of Hissar. The foolish boys had
taken the animals up into the hills, where
no men were near."</p>

<p>"Karim has learned to read our language,
and to behave properly," said
Grandmother. "Perhaps he will find
grace in the eyes of the agha, so that he
may want him as a servant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Dada, do you think that could
be?" cried Karim.</p>

<p>"I shall beg this of the agha," said
Dada, "and the mullah has promised
to help me. If God will, we shall find
favour, and all our faces will be made
white with joy."</p>

<p>On the next day a horseman arrived,
to announce that the agha himself would
come within a week. When the horseman
reached the door of Abdullah's house,
Abdullah met him with low bows, and
said, "This is no longer my house, but
yours. I am your servant."</p>

<p>The rider got off his horse and went
into the house. Here Nana had ready as
tasty a supper as she could cook.</p>

<p>The next day the "white beards" (old
men who manage village affairs) came
to call. They brought two large trays
piled high with apples, grapes and pears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with a coat of blue broadcloth, and one
toman in money. Now for three days
everyone was busy. The agha's house was
swept, carpets were put down, and plenty
of food made ready for cooking. Most
important of all, the money tax was collected.
This must be paid to the agha
because he was the master of the village.
Abdullah was the "kedkhoda" or village
head.</p>

<p>Sometimes the taxes made him and the
white beards very anxious, for all the
money must be collected. But this year
the harvest had been a good one, and
only three men told Abdullah that they
could not pay what was expected. The
white beards were much displeased.</p>

<p>They said, "You will make our faces
black before our agha. We shall have
to tell him, 'These three men only did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
not pay.' What he will do God knows.
Our agha has many ferashes."</p>

<p>The three men cried, and their wives
screamed and tore their hair. They offered
to pay one half, or three quarters,
but the white beards only replied,</p>

<p>"We must leave it to the agha."</p>

<p>Finally, on the day before the agha
arrived, the last shahi due was paid to
Abdullah.</p>

<p>The master looked very much pleased
the next afternoon, when Abdullah and
the white beards, with many bows, offered
him the taxes in full, with a present
of ten tomans and three large baskets of
grapes besides.</p>

<p>"You have made my face white," he
said. "And you, kedkhoda; in all of
my villages I have no one better than
you. You have made my eyes to shine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
speak, then, that I may make your face
white. What wish have you?"</p>

<p>"O agha!" replied Abdullah, "what
we have done is nothing, it is dirt, and
we are as the dirt under your feet. And
yet, since you have stooped to notice me,
and have filled my mouth with sugar by
your words, I have indeed a request, that
I shall make, since you so command.</p>

<p>"I have a son. He is a worthless boy,
indeed, and yet he has studied long with
our mullah, and has read the holy Koran,
and the books of the poets. If he could
live with you, if only to sweep the straw
for your horse's stall, why, then, indeed
you would lift my head to the clouds and
fill my mouth with laughing."</p>

<p>"Is he with you?" asked the agha.
"Let him enter."</p>

<p>The man at the door called Karim,
who was waiting outside, dressed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
new blue broadcloth coat. As he entered
he bowed low, and then stood at the end
of the room, politely covering his hands
in his coat-sleeves.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the agha.</p>

<p>"Thanks to God, your servant's name
is Karim."</p>

<p>"Which of our poets have you read?"</p>

<p>"A few of the pearls of wisdom of
Sheikh Sa'adi have lodged in my skull,
thanks to the thumpings of our mullah."</p>

<p>"Indeed," added Abdullah, proudly,
"he is not stupid. If it please you, he
can recite well."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the agha. "Let me
hear you, my lad."</p>

<p>So Karim recited a poem, in a sing-song
voice, as he had been trained by the
mullah.</p>

<p>As he closed the agha rubbed his hands
with pleasure. "This is wonderful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Who would have expected such knowledge
in a village peasant? You say that
the mullah taught you. He shall have
a reward for such faithful service. And
you," he added, turning to Abdullah,
"your request is granted. Nasr'ullah,
my groom, will find a place for your son
with him."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>KARIM LEAVES HOME</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the agha went back to the city
to become its governor Karim bade
good-bye to his parents and went with
him. He was one of the stable boys for
Nasr'ullah the groom.</p>

<p>He now lived on the grounds of the
governor's palace. One entered these
grounds through large gates of wood.
The gateway was faced with bright red
brick arranged in pretty patterns.</p>

<p>Then came a large court yard, paved
with stone, and surrounded with rooms for
Nasr'ullah and those who helped him.
In one of these Karim slept. A large
doorway near by led to a long line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
stalls, where twenty riding horses were
kept, with their saddles, saddle cloths and
bridles hanging ready for use at a half
hour's notice.</p>

<p>From this court yard a small gate way
opened into another and larger yard.
Here were broad walks paved with flat
stones and bordered with little plots of
green grass, rose bushes and small beds
of bright yellow and red flowers. A few
mulberry trees gave a pleasant shade.
There were two great stone rimmed tanks
full of water.</p>

<p>Around this court yard were many
rooms. The reception room was large,
with white walls and windows of stained
glass. Its floor was covered with richly
coloured carpets. The tea room had soft
divans along the walls, with wide windows
to catch the breeze. There were
also rooms for the governor's son, Ardashir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Khan, and for the mirza (secretary)
who taught him, and for the servants.
Beyond were the kitchens, where
the men in charge always kept tea and
food ready, because no one could tell
just when a visitor might come with his
attendants.</p>

<p>In all about fifty men had work to
do about the palace. All of them were
given their meals, and many slept there.</p>

<p>Behind the great court yard was another
yard, almost as large, into which
Karim never entered, as it was reserved
for the ladies of the governor's family,
and for the women and girls who served
them.</p>

<p>The court yard was shaded by tall
chenars (a kind of sycamore), and had
in it streams of water, plots of grass, rose
bushes, flower beds, and a grape arbour.</p>

<p>In the branches of the chenars, thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
feet above the ground, were two nests of
the "Hajji Legleg," or stork. This bird
was called "hajji," or "pilgrim," because
storks fly away each fall and always
return to their nests in the spring. They
were never disturbed, because they were
said to bring good luck. They reminded
Karim of his own village, where two
pairs of storks had made their nests for
years. He had heard of one village
where there were twenty or thirty nests,
on the trees, walls, and even on the roofs
of the houses.</p>

<p>He had often watched the parent
storks, one at a time, brooding over the
blue eggs or feeding their young. Father
Stork used to feed the mother while she
was sitting, dropping from his bill into
hers such tidbits as live frogs or snakes
captured from the little swamps near the
river, and around the ponds. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the three or four young storks had hatched
the father and mother took turns in their
work. One stayed at home and guarded
the children, while the other hunted for
food. When the hunter came in sight of
the nest he made a great noise clapping
with his bill, for storks have no call, and
his mate answered him. The young storks
made a low sound something like a kitten's
mews as they sat with their long bills
wide open, waiting for breakfast to drop
in; they spent much time, too, leaping
up and down in their nests like Jacks-in-the-box,
exercising their wings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>KARIM GOES TO MARKET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Karim's</span> first work was to help take
care of the horses. It was not always
easy, for they were splendid animals, high
spirited and vicious, and ready to break
away, if possible, in order to get into a
fierce fight with each other. After Karim
learned to ride, he asked Nasr'ullah if he
could not be one of the attendants of
Ardashir Khan, the agha's son, on his
horseback rides.</p>

<p>"I can let you have a horse," said
Nasr'ullah, "but I have no good saddle
to spare. The khan is very particular."</p>

<p>"May I go if I get a new saddle?"
asked Karim, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"If God will, I am willing," said
Nasr'ullah.</p>

<p>So Karim got his money and started
to the shops or "bazaars." He went down
the narrow street and past the graveyard,
with its rude slabs of untrimmed stone,
and on to the bazaars. Here the street was
roofed over by a row of little domes, with
round openings above for light and air.
It was crowded with people. There were
women wrapped in shapeless masses of
blue cloth, with faces carefully covered;
long robed "sayids" with green turbans
on to show that they were descendants of
the prophet Muhammad; peasants passed
in old and ragged coats; city men in
blue broadcloth and tall black hats, and
Kurds from the mountains, wearing
bright coloured coats, baggy trousers,
and wide red belts, in which were thrust
big daggers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, in a corner, sat a man roasting
"kabobs," bits of meat which he deftly
wrapped in flaps of bread and sold. The
purchasers took them in their fingers and
ate them at once. Here were shops where
a dozen men were making a great noise
hammering out brass vases, bowls and
tea urns. Just beyond were the shops of
the saddle makers. There Karim saw
just the saddle he wanted. He stepped
to the edge of the shop and looked at it.
The shop keeper looked up from the
strap he was cutting.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you," said Karim.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you," replied the shop
keeper, eyeing Karim's good coat and
new hat. "With God's blessing have you
come. I can see by your looks that you
are a good rider and know good saddles.
Let me show you this one. It is fit for
King Solomon himself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am looking for a saddle," replied
Karim, feeling pleased, "and it must be
a good one, suited to an attendant of
Ardashir Khan, the son of the governor.
But I am not as rich as King Solomon,
and cannot buy saddles fitted for him."</p>

<p>"Indeed, may I be your sacrifice!"
cried the shop keeper. "This saddle is a
very poor gift, but take it, for you are
a servant of our good governor, whom I
hope God will bless. It is a present. My
eyes for it, just command me, and it's
yours."</p>

<p>"O no," said Karim, "of course I
could not rob you so. I shall buy it, and
pay you good money. What's your
price?"</p>

<p>"No!" insisted the shop keeper, "take
it. It is yours, with God's blessing."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Karim. "I will buy
it. What is your price?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The shop keeper looked disappointed.
"If you won't take the saddle as a
present," he said, "you must name your
own price. I can <i>sell</i> nothing to the
servant of our governor, whom I hope
God will bless. Name a price, my soul;
anything, and it is yours."</p>

<p>"Since you say I must name a price,"
said Karim, feeling rather at sea, "I will
give one toman."</p>

<p>"What!" screamed the shop keeper,
"only one toman for a saddle fit for the
hero Rustem! What pack horse's saddle
would cost so little? Ten tomans could
not buy it."</p>

<p>"Fit for Rustem, indeed!" said
Karim, scornfully. "My master's mule
driver would be ashamed to ride on it.
See how the leather is worn, here, and
here, and here. One toman is too
much, but my master is generous, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I must be. Take eleven krans, and thank
God."</p>

<p>"This is the way you servants of the
khans laugh at my beard, and grind the
faces of us who are poor. The leather
alone of this saddle cost more than
eleven krans. If I sold it for seven
tomans, I would be giving it away."</p>

<p>"Your beard indeed saves you," said
Karim, "for it is long, and I must treat
you with respect. For the sake of your
beard I'll offer fifteen krans."</p>

<p>"It is plain you are a country bumpkin,
and do not know what saddles are worth,"
said the shop keeper. "Ask any one of
these merchants here, and he will tell you
that if I sell the saddle for six tomans I
shall lose money. But our governor, your
master, is a good man. For his sake take
it for five and a half."</p>

<p>In reply Karim offered two tomans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The shop keeper came down to five.</p>

<p>They kept on disputing in this way
until at last Karim bought the saddle for
three tomans. He carried it home on
his shoulder, and began to brag to the
other servants about his bargain.</p>

<p>But the groom laughed at him.</p>

<p>"The shop keeper was right," he said,
"you are a bumpkin. Why did you tell
him you were a servant of the governor?
They sell saddles like this in the bazaars
every day for two tomans."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>KARIM AT THE PALACE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nasr'ullah</span> was true to his promise,
for he saw that Karim was large for his
age, and had already learned how to
manage horses.</p>

<p>Ardashir Khan, the agha's son, was very
fond of riding, and was often in the
saddle. Sometimes there was simply a
ride across country to the hills, made gay
by feats of horsemanship. The young
khan and his friends, with their servants,
rode madly at full speed in small circles,
or pretended to get into a fight and fired
their guns when at full run. At other
times there was a party to hunt quail or
partridge with the aid of falcons and dogs.</p>

<p>But one of the pleasantest excursions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was to a garden-house, surrounded by
tall trees and grassy lawns. Here the
young khans, in a cool porch beside a
pool of clear water, drank the tea prepared
by their servants, and smoked the
pipe, while they enjoyed each other's jokes
and stories.</p>

<p>One story of which no one seemed to
tire, if it was well told, was about the
disappointments of the lovers Leila and
Majnoun.</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF LEILA AND MAJNOUN</h3>

<p>Leila was the beautiful daughter of a
chieftain who camped with his followers
in tents, and wandered over the country,
going wherever he could find water and
grass for his flocks of sheep. Once he
stopped near a village where dwelt a
noble young man, Majnoun. Leila lived
a freer life than the women and girls who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
were in the villages, and was allowed to
wander over the hillsides with uncovered
face; in this way she happened to meet
Majnoun. They fell deeply in love with
each other, and often met among the
lonely hillside rocks. Leila's father did
not know of this, or he would have been
displeased, for Majnoun was not a chieftain,
like himself.</p>

<p>One day Majnoun was astounded to
find the place empty where the chief's
tent had been. It seemed hopeless to
find him, for no one knew in which
direction he had gone, but Majnoun did
not give up. He left his father's house
and wandered through all the neighbouring
region, searching for the encampment.
Although his search was in vain, he loved
Leila so that he could not give up, but
wandered in all directions searching
eagerly for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The weeks lengthened to months, and
the months to years, but still he could not
find her.</p>

<p>Meantime Leila was as much distressed
as was Majnoun. But it was impossible
for her to search, for she was a woman,
and must remain at home. All she could
do was to weep in secret and sing songs or
compose little verses that told of her grief.</p>

<p>After a time the chief of another tribe,
who had heard of Leila's beauty, came
with many horsemen and splendid presents
to ask her father if he might marry
her. Her father was much pleased, but
poor Leila was heart broken. When her
father heard that she was unwilling to
be married he became angry.</p>

<p>"My daughter is of age," he said,
"and her suitor is wealthy and of high
rank. What more can she want? She
must be married to the chief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>So the wedding was celebrated with a
great deal of expense, and every one was
very happy except the bride.</p>

<p>There was now no hope for Leila, but
she could not forget her lover. Long years
passed, and she heard nothing of Majnoun.
Yet she did not forget him. She used to
wander alone over the mountain side near
her husband's tents, singing of her disappointment.</p>

<p>One day she heard her song answered
by a well remembered voice, singing, like
her, of a long lost love. And so at last they
had found each other. But it was a very
sad meeting. Leila was too honourable
to disgrace her husband and herself by
running off with Majnoun, and he was
too noble to wish her to do so. They
could only express their grief in song,
and then bid farewell to each other for
ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>After Karim had become well acquainted
with the governor's servants he
persuaded Musa, who had charge of such
matters, to allow him to be one of the
men who waited upon the agha when he
had callers. Karim stood at the door with
hands covered until it was time to bring
in the tea or "kalian," or water pipe,
in which the smoke was drawn first
through water and then through a long
tube to cool it. Karim brought it in and
silently placed it before a guest, who
took a few whiffs, and then passed it to
the man next him. This man did the
same, and in this way the pipe was passed
along the whole line of guests, sitting
against the walls on either side of the governor.</p>

<p>The tea was served in little tumblers. It
was made with plenty of sugar, and was so
hot that the guest made a noise when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
drinking it, drawing in air to keep from
scalding his mouth.</p>

<p>The governor usually treated his guests
very politely, although he did not rise
as they entered, because he was of higher
rank than they.</p>

<p>When he wished to show very great
honour to a caller he beckoned to him
to come and sit by his side. He kissed
him on both cheeks, and asked him
quickly, "Is your health good? Is your
appetite good? Are you healthy, and fat?
Your coming is delightful. Your arrival
is most pleasant. You have come on my
eyes."</p>

<p>But he was not always so gracious.
Once a very rich khan called, bringing
a letter which he wished to present. It
happened that he was very near-sighted,
and usually wore glasses. But to wear
glasses when calling on the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
would have been impolite, so he took
them off before entering. It was an
amusing sight to see his eyes rolling as
he walked up the carpet trying to pick
out the governor from among the callers
who were seated by him. To have given
the letter to the wrong man would have
been a great insult. Luckily, he made
no mistake, and, bowing low, handed the
governor the letter. The governor
opened and read it, then tore it up and
threw it out of the window, and began
to converse again with the other callers.
Meantime the khan stood patiently waiting,
for to speak without being first
spoken to was impolite, and to leave without
permission an insult.</p>

<p>At last he said to the governor, "With
your permission, may I be excused?"</p>

<p>"You were excused before you came,"
replied the governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>So the khan managed to get away,
backing all the way to the door (to turn
around would be improper), and bowing
again and again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>SOHRAB AND RUSTEM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> governor's mirza (or secretary)
was very friendly with Karim, and allowed
him to read his books. He had
a fine copy of the "Shah Nameh" or
"Book of Kings," by the great poet Firdousi.
It was very large, and full of stirring
poetry describing the wonderful
deeds of kings and heroes who lived long
ago. The greatest of them was Rustem. At
eight years of age he was as strong as any
hero of that time. This is one of the famous
stories that Karim most enjoyed.</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF SOHRAB AND RUSTEM</h3>

<p>Rustem once went on a hunting trip
that led him to the boundaries of Persia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Becoming tired after a long day's chase,
he lay down to sleep, leaving his splendid
horse Rakush to graze near by. Some
Tartar robbers, creeping up, led away
the horse. Rustem, when he awoke, followed
the hoofprints until he arrived at
the kingdom of Samengan. Its king came
to meet the hero, and promised to give
back his horse if he became his guest.
While here Rustem met the king's
daughter, the princess Tamineh. They
fell in love and were married with great
splendour.</p>

<p>It was not possible for Rustem to live
long with his bride, because he was
needed by his lord, the king of Persia.
He was compelled to leave Tamineh before
he could even see the baby that was
born. But he sent them a splendid present.</p>

<p>The baby was a boy, and Tamineh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
said to herself, "If Rustem hears that
his child is a boy he will send for him,
and leave me desolate." So she told the
messenger who brought the present that
the child was a girl. Tamineh named
her son Sohrab. As he grew up he became
very strong and brave. When he
was ten years old she told him that his
father was Rustem, but added, "If you
let this be known Rustem's enemies will
try to kill you, for he is hated by many
warriors here, because he has beaten them
in battle."</p>

<p>When Sohrab was fourteen years old
he was as strong as the greatest warrior.
He now declared that he intended to conquer
Kaoos, the king of Persia, and to
make Rustem king in his stead. King
Afraysiab, who was a great enemy of the
Persians, heard of this plan. He thought
to himself, "Sohrab is the only hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
strong enough to meet Rustem. If I
can keep him from recognizing Rustem
perhaps he will kill him as a foe." So
he sent word to Sohrab that he would
join with him in the war. But secretly
he told his generals, Human and Bahman,
that they should not permit Sohrab to
recognize Rustem, and that if they could
they should bring the two together in
battle.</p>

<p>When the armies met, these generals
arranged with King Kaoos that two
champions, one for each side, should meet
in single combat. The king selected his
greatest hero, Rustem, as the champion
for the Persians. Sohrab, of course, was
chosen by Afraysiab's generals to fight
against him.</p>

<p>Sohrab suspected that his foe was Rustem,
and when they met begged him to
tell his name, but Rustem refused. Twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they fought, and twice Sohrab conquered.
But he was moved by a strange love for
his foe, and, though victor, spared his
life.</p>

<p>And now the third and last day of the
struggle arrived.</p>

<p>As Sohrab was putting on his armour
he looked at the Persian hero, and said
to Human, "See how strong and brave
my foe appears! just such a man as my
mother said that Rustem is. He surely
is Rustem."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Human, "I know
Rustem's appearance well. That horse,
it is true, looks like Rakush, but is less
strong and beautiful."</p>

<p>The champions now approached each
other.</p>

<p>Sohrab, again in doubt, spoke, "Let
us sit here as friends, for my heart is
drawn to you. Be as generous as I am,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and tell me who you are! Say, are you
Rustem, whom I long to know?"</p>

<p>"Away with your excuses!" cried Rustem.
"We meet to fight. I claim the
struggle."</p>

<p>"Old man," said Sohrab, "you refuse
to listen to me. Then take care for yourself!"</p>

<p>Each now tied his horse, tightened his
belt, and rubbed his arms and wrists in
angry excitement, for the struggle was to
be by wrestling. And now the heroes
meet and clasp; in the terrible strain
they seem like raging elephants. The
ground grows black with the blood and
sweat that drops from their straining
bodies. Sohrab threw himself forward
with a sudden spring and seized his
enemy around the belt. Rustem, feeling
his strength give way, fell heavily to the
ground. Sohrab leaned over to kill him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but Rustem cried out, "Hold! Do you
not know the law? It gives the beaten
man a second chance."</p>

<p>This was a crafty lie. Sohrab believed
it. He left his foe, and went proudly
back to the cheering ranks of his friends.
Careless he waited, and made no preparation
for the next fight. But Rustem went
to a stream, and bathed his limbs, and
prayed for the strength that once had
been his.</p>

<p>The two then met again. Sohrab
scornfully exclaimed, "You dare to meet
me, do you? Are you looking for a death
with honour, because you have been
beaten so often? But you care not, old
man, for the truth, and perhaps you
have another trick to try. Twice already
have I spared you just because you are
old."</p>

<p>"You are young and haughty," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Rustem, "but perhaps my aged arm will
yet subdue your pride."</p>

<p>Then they rushed to the fight, tugging
and bending, and twisting their great
limbs, until Rustem with a mighty effort
grasped Sohrab. Bending his back, he
hurled him to the ground. But he knew
that he was not strong enough to keep
him there, so he quickly drew his dagger
and stabbed him.</p>

<p>Sohrab writhed in pain as he said, "Do
not now boast in your pride; I have
brought this upon myself. Fate ordered
that you should kill me. O, if only I
could have seen my father! My mother
told me how to recognize him, and I
sought for him. My only wish is to see
him, and here I die alone! But do not
hope to escape him! Wherever you flee,
Rustem in sorrow and anger will pursue
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Rustem shook with horror at these
words. His brain reeled; at last with
a groan he cried, "Prove you are mine!
For I am Rustem!"</p>

<p>Sohrab stared wildly at him, and said,
"If you are Rustem, you have indeed a
cruel heart, else you would have known
me long ago. Take from my arm its
coat of mail, and see there the golden
bracelet you left with my mother."</p>

<p>Rustem tore off the mail; at the sight
of the gleaming bracelet he fell to the
ground, crying, "By my own hand my
son, my son is killed!"</p>

<p>Lying in the dust, with groans, in his
despair he tore his hair and clothing.</p>

<p>Meantime the sun had set, and Rakush,
forgotten by his master, started for the
camp and entered the ranks of the waiting
Persians. They saw the empty saddle,
and in fear galloped to the battle ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The dying Sohrab heard the tramp of
their horses, and said, "Let peace come
from my death. Beseech King Kaoos to
spare the Tartar army, for they are not
to blame. I am to blame. I sought to
find you. And how often did I look for
my father Rustem, and how sure I felt
that you were he. But you denied it,
and yet I could not kill you. Now Fate
has disappointed all my hopes, and
stained your hands with my life blood."</p>

<p>The soldiers approached, and horror
came upon them as they saw the agony
of Rustem.</p>

<p>"Here ends the war," he said to them;
then, looking at his dying son, he groaned,
"Oh what a curse has come upon a parent's
head!"</p>

<p>In his despair he drew his weapon, to
kill himself, but the Persian captains
seized his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, arousing, he exclaimed to the
chief Gudurz, "Hasten! hasten to King
Kaoos, and beg of him the medicine he
has that yet will save my son! Remind
him of my deeds for him, and entreat
that he send it for my sake." Gudurz galloped
to the king, but the cruel king replied,
"Can I forgive that shameless boy,
who scorned me with my army, and
sought my throne? Only a fool would
save the life of such a foe."</p>

<p>Gudurz returned with this bitter message.
Rustem then left his dying son,
and hastened himself to the king. But
while he was yet on the way a messenger
brought word that Sohrab was dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>NEW OPPORTUNITIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Often</span> the governor had dinner parties
for his friends. These were always a
delight to Karim, who helped to make the
room ready. First the servants spread
upon the richly woven carpet a coloured
cloth that covered the entire centre of the
long room. Along the edges of this cloth
a man next spread the large flaps of thin
whole wheat bread. Then the centre was
filled with all kinds of good things to
eat. There were large plates heaped high
with pilav, well buttered and mixed with
bits of orange and spices, and topped
with pieces of well cooked chicken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Near by in other dishes were bits of mutton
in spiced gravies. The yellow curry,
in saucers, was placed near the rice, all
ready to be mixed with it. Other dishes
held cold rice, cooked in milk and sugar
until it was almost solid. Often there
were large dishes of cucumbers, tomatoes,
or apples, with their centres cut out and
filled with spiced meats and thoroughly
cooked. There were side dishes of sweet
preserves, and of red peppers.</p>

<p>The guests left their shoes at the door,
and sat down on the floor next to the
table cloth. Each rested on his heels,
flattening out the instep. He was careful
not to move his legs at all during the
meal, no matter how tired they became,
because that would suggest that he was
not enjoying the entertainment. Each
guest was also careful to sit further from
the governor than other guests of higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
rank. If he did not, the guest whose
place he had taken would probably have
disgraced him by making him get up and
change his seat.</p>

<p>When the eating began every one was
busy. Each tore off little pieces of bread,
and with their help took the meat or rice
from the dishes. There were no separate
plates, or knives or forks. Once in a
while the governor with his own hand
poked a piece of food into the mouth of
the guest who sat next to him. This was
a great compliment. The servants went
softly about in stocking feet, seeing that
the dishes were kept full.</p>

<p>When all had eaten enough, the table
cloth was cleared, and sherbet, or sweetened
water, was brought in, with plates
of candy and small sweet cakes. Karim
carried around a pitcher of water, while
another servant went with him, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a basin and towel. Each guest washed
his hands. By this time many in the
room were laughing and chatting. Sometimes
the conversation was kept up for
several hours, until tea and the kalian
had been passed around.</p>

<p>Meantime the servants, in another
room, were having a splendid feast with
the food left by the guests. So much
was cooked that there was always plenty
to spare. When they finished eating, the
dishes were passed out to the hostlers;
lastly, the hostlers passed on the scraps to
the beggars waiting at the gate, so that
nothing was lost.</p>

<p>One day, when Karim was sitting alone
in the mirza's room, a stranger entered.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you," said Karim.</p>

<p>"May you have peace. Is not the
mirza in?"</p>

<p>"He has been called by the agha&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
life God will lengthen!&mdash;and is
very busy."</p>

<p>"Has he no time, then, to write a letter
for me? Do you know of any one who
can compose a good letter?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Karim, who wanted
to show what he knew, "the mirza, when
I help him, says that my writing is second
only to his. If my letter does not please
you, come again when the mirza is not
busy. What is your need?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday," said the man, "a merchant
sent me some splendid pomegranates.
He has made my face to shine, and
I wish to thank him. I wish also to beg
him to send me some more."</p>

<p>Karim opened the pen case, and took
out a reed pen, which he sharpened and
smoothed. Then he took a roll of paper,
trimmed it with the scissors, and rubbed
its edges with saffron. Putting the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
on his knee as he sat on the floor he began
to write, pushing the pen across the paper
from right to left.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i0144.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="Boy and man sitting on rug" />
<div class="caption">"PUTTING THE PAPER ON HIS KNEE AS HE SAT ON THE FLOOR."</div>
</div>

<p>When he was through he read the
letter to the man.</p>

<p>"That is just the kind of letter I
want," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Karim, "I shall seal
it. Where is your seal?"</p>

<p>He took the man's seal, engraved on
a bit of agate, and after wetting it with
the thick ink, pressed it on the paper.
Then he folded the letter and handed it
to the man, who thanked him many
times, and offered him ten shahis in payment.</p>

<p>When Karim told the mirza what he
had written the latter said, "You have
learned quickly from me how to compose
well. Let me keep on teaching you, and
you will become almost as skilful as I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a translation of the letter that
Karim composed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My kind, honourable and respected
master, whose honour I hope may last:</p>

<p>"Just when my weak mind was planning
to ask you about the state of your
health, which is so important to us, the
noble, famous and wise Sayid Ibrahim
(I hope that his life may be lengthened!)
unexpectedly gave me your kind letter.
When I opened the letter it seemed to
me that I was uncorking a bottle of rose-water.
When its perfume of love reached
the nose of my soul, because it brought
me the news of your good health, I was
as full of joy as I could be. And by
showing me your favour, that is, by sending
me the pomegranates, you have made
me very glad. I hope that you will always
gladden my heart with this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of favour, each year sending me the
happy news of your own good health.
My longing eye is all the time looking
up the street.</p>

<p>"I wish this letter to carry some sign
of my love, so I am sending you with it
a pair of gloves. Wear them, please, for
the sake of remembering me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Karim</span> used to go back several times
a year to spend a week or two with Abdullah
and Nana. They were always
delighted to see him and to hear of his
new life, and much pleased with the
presents he brought.</p>

<p>On one of these visits Nana asked him
whether he did not wish to become betrothed.
Karim at once felt very bashful,
but at last told his mother whom he
was thinking of, and she promised to
speak to Abdullah about it. She did so
that very afternoon.</p>

<p>"Master," she said, "you know that
your son is now fifteen years old, and
ought to be betrothed. He told me this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
morning that he wishes us to ask Shahbaz
if he will not let him marry his daughter
Kadija."</p>

<p>"K'choo!" sneezed Dada, and then
blinked at the sun, for good luck. Both
waited quietly for a minute, and then
Nana exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Awý! What bad luck! God has
shown us that we should not ask for
Kadija."</p>

<p>"There are other girls," said Dada,
and after a long talk that evening with
Karim they decided to ask Suleiman for
his daughter.</p>

<p>Next morning Dada started out to ask
Mashaddi to tell his mother to see Suleiman
about this. On the way he greeted
Husain.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you."</p>

<p>"May you have peace," replied Husain.
"Where are you going?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"What luck!" muttered Dada, and
went back home again.</p>

<p>"Why have you come back so soon?"
asked Grandmother in surprise.</p>

<p>"That fool Husain asked me a question
that brings bad luck," said Dada,
"so of course I came back to start out
over again. A person cannot be too careful
at a time like this."</p>

<p>"We seem to be having bad luck about
it all," replied Grandmother. "I had
hoped that Kadija was the right girl, but
of course, since you sneezed only once,
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"K'chee! K'choo!" broke in Nana.</p>

<p>"Praise be to God!" exclaimed Grandmother.
"We were talking of Kadija,
and Nana sneezed twice. You know that
means the best of luck. Let us ask for
her."</p>

<p>Shahbaz was much pleased when Mashaddi's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mother told him what Abdullah
was hoping for. When Abdullah learned
this he sent rice and meat and butter to
Shahbaz' house, and later came himself
with Mashaddi and a few other friends,
carrying as presents, among other things,
a ring and a pair of shoes, and a large
tray covered with candy, with a red
handkerchief spread over the top.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you, my brothers," said
Shahbaz.</p>

<p>"May you have peace," replied Abdullah.
"I have come to ask whether
you are willing to marry the light of your
eyes, your daughter Kadija, to my son
Karim."</p>

<p>"You show me so much more honour
than I can possibly deserve in asking
this," said Shahbaz, politely, "that I am
too much overcome to trust myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
answer you. I must ask my mother and
my brother about it."</p>

<p>He went in to ask them, and came back
in fifteen minutes, all smiles.</p>

<p>"My daughter is like a pair of shoes
to your son," he said.</p>

<p>"Praise be to God!" exclaimed Abdullah,
and sent the ring in to Kadija,
who of course was keeping out of sight
of the men.</p>

<p>Her grandmother put it upon the girl's
finger, thus showing that she was now betrothed
to Karim. Then the men all sat
down to a dinner cooked from the food
Abdullah had sent.</p>

<p>After this Abdullah was careful to send
a present to Shahbaz once in a while&mdash;a
chicken, or a lamb, or a toman or two.
It would have been more improper than
ever for Karim to visit Kadija, now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they were betrothed. As she did not know
how to read he could not send her notes,
but had to trust that Nana or Grandmother
would tell Kadija what he wished
her to know. This was very hard to
bear whenever he was at home on a
visit, but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>One day the mirza said, "Karim, you
know about that dog of a Kurd, Sheikh
Tahar, who captured the governor's soldiers
among the mountains, coming on
them while they were asleep, and who
robbed the village of Dizza. Now he has
sent a letter to the governor in which he
asks that some one be sent to talk with him
and make peace. The governor is going to
send Abbas Khan. He wants a mirza to
go with him. I have taught you to compose
and write well. I am old; why
should I trot about among the mountains
to please that dog of a Kurd? The work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
will be an honour to you. Let me recommend
you."</p>

<p>So it came about that a few days later
Karim was riding over the plain towards
the mountain pass with Abbas Khan
and his forty horsemen. Each man carried
a breech-loading gun, with a pistol
at the pommel and a dagger in his
belt.</p>

<p>The road passed over the flat plain,
by a river, now running quietly below
high banks in its wide and stony bed, for
it was late in the summer. In the spring,
after the rains, the bed was filled from
bank to bank with an angry torrent of
muddy water. Crossing a bridge, with
arches of red brick, and small towers at
either end, built by a rich man as a
good deed, to help him enter heaven
when he died, they entered the village
where they were to stop for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The kedkhoda and village white beards
met them with many bows.</p>

<p>Almost every house had one or more
guests that night. Karim and the major
who commanded the forty horsemen were
together in a room that had a rude framework
of poles along one side. From its
top stretched downwards a long line of
woollen threads of different colours. On
the little stools in front, the women of
the house sat while hour after hour for
days at a time they patiently wove in
and out the coloured wool thread that
slowly built up a beautiful Persian carpet.
None of these women had ever read
a book telling how to weave, or had ever
seen a pattern of the bright figures they
wove into the rug. They had learned
the patterns by practice under the direction
of their mothers. Their mothers
had learned them in the same way. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
now the girls were sitting before the
loom and learning by practice to weave
the same patterns.</p>

<p>A small boy told them some interesting
news.</p>

<p>"People say," he said, "that the king
of the fleas lives in this village with half
the fleas of the plain. We don't mind
them, but many travellers can't sleep."</p>

<p>Karim laughed at this. He had never
bothered himself much about such little
things, but before morning he was quite
ready to believe the boy.</p>

<small>AMONG THE KURDS</small></h2>

<div class="caption">A KURDISH SHEPHERD.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> started early the next morning.
The road first led through a plain, between
rice fields flooded with water from
a large ditch. Next it wound past vineyards
with bunches of white and purple
grapes, and fields of glistening wheat
stubble. Then, passing up a long valley,
they crossed uplands covered with
thick rich grass, quite different from the
bare hills so often seen. In the distance
grazed large flocks of sheep, guarded by
Kurdish shepherds, stern, wild-looking
men, with baggy trousers and jackets of
many colours, and large peaked felt hats.
Each had several daggers in his belt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
They were followed by dogs as large
and almost as fierce as wolves.</p>

<p>Beyond, on entering a little valley, they
suddenly came upon the tents of an encampment
of Kurds. The tents were of
thick black felt, long and irregular in
shape, and held up by a great many
poles. The flaps were partly open for
the air. There was not much to be seen
inside; rugs here and there lay on the
ground, and bedding was rolled in large
bundles. A few dishes and kettles were
near the hearth, and here and there hung
large sheep skins sewed into a rounded
shape and filled with milk ready to be
churned.</p>

<p>On the poles hung guns and daggers,
and bridles for the horses, with the saddles
and saddle-cloths beneath. The
horses themselves were grazing near by,
each tethered by his leg with a rope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a stake. When the Persians appeared the
women and children rushed into the
tents, from which they looked out on the
party, the dogs barked fiercely, and the
few men who were lounging around with
their guns handy scowled darkly when
they replied to the major's "Peace be
with you."</p>

<p>They stopped for the night in a village
at the foot of a small cliff, on whose crest
were the ruined walls of a castle. Karim
walked up to see it.</p>

<p>The wall, of cobble stone, had once
been about twelve feet high and went
around that part of the crest not protected
by the cliff. Within were the tumbled
walls of houses, and three large cracked
cisterns, meant to catch rain water. On
the farther side was the arched opening
to an underground passage, whose round
top here and there had been uncovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
by the rains, so that he traced it stretching
down the brown hillside to a spot below
covered with green grass. Near him,
in the wall, was a gateway, protected by
a tower of cut stone. Near this tower
was a strange recess that seemed cut into
the rock.</p>

<p>The village boys with Karim said that
this was a holy place, because the prophet
Ali had been there. He had been flying
through the air when going home from a
visit to a holy shrine, and had stopped to
rest. As he leaned back against the rock
he pushed it in and so made the recess.
He was able to do such a wonderful thing
because he was a very holy man.</p>

<p>That evening Karim heard the story of
the destruction of the castle. Here it is:</p>

<p>About fifty years before, the castle was
the home of a Kurdish chief, or sheikh,
who gave a great deal of trouble to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
governor in the city. He robbed the villages
and the caravans, and never paid
taxes or gave any presents to the governor.
The governor did not have enough
soldiers to punish the sheikh, so at last
the ruler of the province came with an
army and besieged the castle. He placed
guards on all sides, so that no one could
go in or come out. He put a cannon on
a large white stone on the hillside opposite,
and fired at the castle. This troubled
the sheikh very much, but still he did not
surrender. So the Persians called the
peasants who lived in the villages near
by and asked them how the sheikh was
able to get water to drink. Some peasants
told about the secret passage down to
water, but as it was carefully covered no
one knew just where to find it. So the
Persian ruler took a mule, and ordered
that for several days it be given plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
food, but no water to drink. In this way
the mule became very thirsty. Then the
ruler ordered his men to lead it slowly
around the castle. When the mule had
been led almost all the way around it
suddenly stopped and began pawing the
ground, because it smelled water. Here
the Persians dug into the earth, and found
the secret passage way.</p>

<p>Then the sheikh in the castle called his
men together, with their wives and children,
who were with them. He told them
that there was no more hope, for they had
no water, but that they must not fall alive
into the hands of the cruel Persians. Still,
he said, he would not ask them to kill
their own wives and children. He would
let these surrender if they wished to, but
not a man must surrender. The women
cried out that they would rather die than
be taken prisoners. And so they rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with their children to the cliff and threw
themselves over it to death&mdash;all except
one, whose clothes broke the fall. The
men opened the castle gate, and, rushing
out, fought fiercely until all had been
killed by their foes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>RUMOURS OF WAR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day for three hours they
climbed up a rocky valley, and then
crossed a high ridge, from whose summit
they saw a plain at the foot of snow
capped mountains.</p>

<p>"Those mountains," said Abbas Khan,
"are Sheikh Tahar's fort. Whenever we
beat him in a fight he hides among their
rocks. What can we do?" Going down
the steep slopes in zigzags, they crossed
some low hills, and entered the plain. A
village lay on its edge, at the foot of some
hills. The top of one of these hills was
surrounded by a high adobe wall. The
people of this village looked very
wretched; they were wearing clothes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were in rags and tatters. The houses
were without window or door frames, and
as one peered through the gaping doors
he saw nothing but the bare floors. No
cattle or sheep could be seen. This was
the village that Sheikh Tahar had robbed.</p>

<p>Next morning the kedkhoda told the
story to Abbas Khan. Karim, as mirza,
wrote down what was said.</p>

<p>"The Kurds," said the kedkhoda, "had
told some of us that they were going to
rob us. At first we did not believe it.
But three days before the great attack
forty of them suddenly came down upon
our shepherds, who were pasturing our
two thousand sheep on the hills. The ten
shepherds came running for help to the
village. We hurried out, thirty of us, but
it was too late. The next day some men
told us that the Kurds were planning to
attack us within two days. The white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
beards talked it over, and we decided to
carry everything that we could into the
walled fort on the hill. We were busy
doing this all the next day, until the
ground inside was covered with boxes,
bundles, plows, yokes, piles of wheat, jars,
and everything else we had. We drove in
the few cattle and sheep we had left, with
our geese and chickens and donkeys. That
evening our watchmen saw many Kurds
on a hill near by. The next morning
there seemed to be hundreds of them.
They got on that hilltop yonder, which, as
you see, is higher than the fort, and fired
at us. We all crowded up beneath the
wall nearest to them, where they could
not hit us with their bullets. Then the
Kurds came up to the wall, yelling like
devils, and threw stones over its top.
They came tumbling so thick that we
could hardly stay next to the wall at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&mdash;but
to move away meant to be shot.
We had guns, but what use were they?
If we had killed any of the Kurds they
would have killed us later. We had no
water, and what help could come to us?
So one of our old men crept to the gate
to try and talk with them; they shot him
dead. Another climbed a ladder against
the wall near the place where some men
from a near by village were throwing
stones at us&mdash;he knew them well&mdash;to
beg them to speak for us to the Kurds;
he fell over with a bullet in his head. So
we just opened the gate and let them in.
They rushed through it like a lot of
wolves, with yells of joy, and began at
once to snatch at everything they could.
They took everything, boxes of clothing,
the wedding outfits of our brides, the
head-dresses of our women, with the
strings of money on them, the cows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sheep and wheat. If they could not unlock
a box they smashed it open. They
made us take off our shoes and coats and
give them up. At last, when there was
not anything else left, they formed in two
long lines outside the gate, and made us
all pass one by one between. If anyone
saw something one of us had that he
wanted he snatched it. And so we got
away, and ran to our houses, weeping, and
some of us bleeding from wounds. There
we found everything stripped bare, as you
see. Now we have nothing left but these
houses, and they are all empty."</p>

<p>All the men of the village in the room
now burst out crying, and the women outside
sobbed and wailed and pulled at their
hair.</p>

<p>"Do not weep," said Abbas Khan.
"The governor will command the people
in the other villages to give you food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
clothes, and will send you wheat to plant
in your fields. He will surely punish the
Kurds, because they have laughed at his
beard, and he is a lion among men."</p>

<p>The next day they rode across the plain
to a large village. The roofs of the houses
here were little above the surface of the
ground. In the house where Karim spent
the night the animals lived in the same
room with the men, and so helped to keep
it warm. He found it hard to sleep.
Two lambs shut under a large basket
bleated pitifully for a long time. Next
some animal startled him from a doze by
beginning to lick his hand. Very early
in the morning the rooster in the room
began to crow, and kept it up at intervals
until dawn. Worst of all, he could only
grumble to himself and not wring the
rooster's neck, even though he was the
servant of the governor. He did not dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to make trouble, because the villagers
here, unlike those near the city, were not
much afraid of the governor, and not at
all afraid of a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>SHEIKH TAHAR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon ten Kurds rode into
the village. Their three leaders were
gaily dressed in baggy red trousers and
blue and crimson jackets. They wore
broad crimson sashes, and red silk streamers
floated from their turbans. All were
armed with rifles and several daggers
apiece, while three carried long lances as
well. Abbas Khan met them at the door
of the house where he was staying, and
the leaders followed him inside, where
they sat together on the cushions at one
end, while a row of well armed Persians
sat around the walls.</p>

<p>Outside, in the yard, four Kurds stood
by the horses. The Persian soldiers gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
around them, and as one Kurd could
speak the Persian language a lively conversation
soon began.</p>

<p>"Our agha is very angry," said one,
"and will never rest until your chief has
eaten dirt before him."</p>

<p>"Wallah!" said the Kurd, "if he wants
him to eat dirt, let him catch him."</p>

<p>"But your chief knows well that he
cannot fight with the Persians," was the
reply. "Because he has trapped a few
sons of dogs when they were asleep does
he think he can face the cannon and horsemen
our agha will send against him?
Wah! if he is wise he will eat a mouthful
of dirt now, instead of many handfuls
later. Is he stronger than was Ismail
Agha?"</p>

<p>"We all know of Ismail Agha," replied
the Kurd. "My cousin's wife's uncle was
there when he was killed. Your general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
came with his horsemen to the foot of the
hill where the Agha's castle was built.
He sent up two khans to ask him to come
down. The khans swore by all that was
holy that no harm would come to him,
and said that they themselves would stay
at the castle gate as hostages if he went.
He was an honest man and believed them.
He rode down the hill with only ten
horsemen with him. After a while the
Kurds at the castle gate heard the sound
of guns. The two Persian khans&mdash;sons
of liars&mdash;with faces full of joy exclaimed,
'Peace has been made. They are shooting
off their guns for joy. Let us ride
down and join in the celebration.' We
Kurds are honest fellows; we did not
shoot them, but turned to mount our
horses&mdash;and they galloped off and left
us. The Kurds pursued, but only to meet
the agha's ten horsemen coming at breakneck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
speed with the news that Ismail
Agha was dead. The general had received
him very politely, but as he turned
to mount his horse after the talk was over
a Persian shot him from behind. But
Sheikh Tahar will not be caught in that
way."</p>

<p>The major now interrupted, saying,
"But our agha does not fight in that way.
He does not use tricks. He has cannon,
and horsemen, and he fights in the
open."</p>

<p>"I know you have cannon," said the
Kurd, "yet still we do not fear. By tricks
you win. But they will not succeed
against Sheikh Tahar. Do you know the
story of the Kurdish fox and the Persian
fox?</p>

<p>"Once these two foxes met. The Kurdish
fox said to the Persian fox,</p>

<p>"'How many tricks do you know?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Persian fox replied, 'I know
twenty-six. How many do you know?'</p>

<p>"'I know only one,' said the Kurdish
fox, 'but it is all I need.'</p>

<p>"They walked on together until the
Persian fox saw a piece of meat and
snapped at it. He found himself caught
in a trap.</p>

<p>"'My brother!' he cried in distress,
'what can I do? Come and help me!'</p>

<p>"'Why do you want help?' said
the Kurdish fox, 'use your twenty-six
tricks.'</p>

<p>"'Really, my brother,' said the Persian
fox, 'not a single one of them is of
any use against this trap.'</p>

<p>"'Well, then,' said the Kurdish fox, 'I
will tell you the one trick that I know.
To-morrow the owner of the trap will
come. You must pretend to be dead. I
shall lie down near at hand, and also pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to be dead. He'll take your foot out
of the trap. You must still pretend to be
dead. He'll see me; then he'll drop you
and come to get me. Then you jump up
and run, and I'll run, too. So we'll both
be free.'</p>

<p>"So the one trick of the Kurdish fox
was better than the twenty-six tricks of the
Persian fox."</p>

<p>The next day Abbas Khan ordered all
to be ready to ride out to meet Sheikh
Tahar, who had promised to come down
for a talk. Everyone was busy, seeing
that the rifles were ready for use, the pistols
loaded, and the saddle girths strong;
the horses were given a good breakfast;
in short, everything was put in order, for
no one knew just what they might have
to do,&mdash;talk, fight, or run away.</p>

<p>About noon all was ready, and they
started. The cavalrymen amused themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and kept up their courage by galloping
in great circles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i0180.jpg" width="600" height="413" alt="horsemen" />
<div class="caption">SHEIKH TAHAR AND HIS HORSEMEN.</div>
</div>

<p>As they approached the mountain, the
Kurdish horsemen came in sight from behind
a hill; they, too, were galloping in
all directions and brandishing their spears.
As they drew nearer both sides gathered
into close groups, and rode on in silence.</p>

<p>There were about seventy-five men with
Sheikh Tahar. Most of these were on
horseback, dressed in baggy red trousers,
wide red sashes, with scarlet and blue
jackets, and wide turbans of red silk.
Each man was a sort of walking arsenal,
with long lines of cartridges, a Martini
Henry rifle, and silver hilted daggers or
swords. But some of the footmen were
dressed in very ragged clothes and two
of them carried old flintlock guns.</p>

<p>When the parties were a few hundred
feet apart both stopped. After a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
minutes Abbas Khan with five Persians
rode forward. On the other side Sheikh
Tahar with five of the gayest clothed
Kurds also rode forward. The sheikh
was a young man, with a heavy moustache
and piercing, cruel eyes. When they met
all twelve dismounted. Some Persian
grooms and Kurdish footmen ran forward
and led the horses off a little distance.
One man spread a carpet on the ground.
On this the two leaders sat down. They
seemed very glad to see each other, for
they kissed one another on the cheeks several
times. After some conversation the
servants brought tea, which they drank
together. Karim noticed that two tea
urns and two sets of tumblers were used,
and that each leader was careful to have
his tea made and poured into his own
glass by his own man. Then they stood
up, kissed each other again, bowed low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and each edged carefully away to his own
company, while every man in sight kept
his rifle cocked.</p>

<p>On the way back Karim asked the
major what the sheikh had said.</p>

<p>He replied, "Sheikh Tahar said that
he knew how just a man our agha was,
and how full of mercy, and how brave.
He loved him so much that when he
found out from the prisoners he had captured
that they were the agha's soldiers he
could not keep the tears from his eyes.
He had not fought the Persian soldiers
because he hated them, but because they
had attacked him. Why did the Persians
believe the lies that Sheikh Rakhim
had told? Sheikh Rakhim was his enemy,
and had killed ten of his men. He had
revenged himself by killing fifteen men
in return. Sheikh Rakhim for this reason
had told lies to the Persians and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
persuaded them to send soldiers against
him.</p>

<p>"Then Abbas Khan asked him why he
had attacked and robbed the village. He
said that the people of that village had
killed two of his men the year before.
Besides, they had helped Sheikh Rakhim's
men, who were really the enemies of the
Persians, although they pretended to be
their friends. Abbas Khan said that he was
delighted to hear this from Sheikh Tahar's
own lips. He said that our agha had sent
soldiers against him because the ruler of
the province had believed the lies told by
Sheikh Rakhim. But the ruler now had
learned what a mistake he had made.
Our agha was anxious to see Sheikh Tahar
and give him the honour he deserved.
Would he not come down to the plain,
near the city, and meet the agha, and be
honoured by him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sheikh Tahar replied that he did not
deserve such honour, but if his good
friend the governor commanded, it was
his part to obey, and he would be pleased
to come if he could. But his brothers
were very angry because the Persians had
killed some of their men. He was afraid
that he could not persuade them to let
him come down. He would come if he
could, for he loved the agha."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will come?" asked
Karim.</p>

<p>"God knows," said the major. "I only
know that Abbas Khan is a big liar, but
that Sheikh Tahar is a bigger one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>A BATTLE AND WHAT CAME OF IT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Abbas Khan with his
company started again for the city, which
they reached after a quiet journey. The
mirza read Karim's reports, and changed
them where necessary, so that they would
be in proper form. Then he read them
to the governor.</p>

<p>"The agha was very angry," he told
Karim afterwards, "when I read how the
village was robbed, and he had me write
a letter to Sheikh Tahar saying that if
he did not come to the city within a
week he would send up an army against
him."</p>

<p>Eight days later all was astir about the
palace, for the agha had ordered four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
thousand men with four cannon to the
mountains. Karim did not go with them.
However, the major told him afterwards
about the fight.</p>

<p>"When we reached the plain at the
foot of the mountains," he said, "Sheikh
Rakhim came to our general. He had
four hundred men with him, and declared
that every one of the four hundred had
taken an oath to capture Sheikh Tahar
either dead or alive. He also said that
he knew where the sheikh was hiding.
Our general gave him a fine horse for a
present.</p>

<p>"Two days later we advanced from the
village toward a mountain. We saw
Sheikh Rakhim's Kurds galloping around
at the foot of the mountain, and heard
their guns. Between us and them was a
large building. Our general told us to
attack it, because Sheikh Tahar was inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it. So we spread out in a long irregular
line, and went slowly ahead, shooting at
the building all the while. They brought
up one of the cannon, too, and boomed
away, but somehow the gunners did not
seem able to hit the building. It took us
an hour to get close to it, and we kept
shooting at it until its walls were full of
bullet marks, and some of the soldiers had
no ammunition left. But not a shot, or
any sound or movement, came in reply.
Finally, when we were quite near, the
general ordered us to charge. My heart
was in my throat, but I just shut my eyes
and ran forward to the wall, thinking every
step would be my last. But I heard nothing,
and so, rushing to the door, I kicked
it open, and looked in. I saw no one inside.
Others came up, and we rushed in, and
looked into all the corners, but the house
was empty. Not a sign of a Kurd, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
even an empty cartridge shell, could we
find. That was all there was of the battle.</p>

<p>"We waited up there a week longer,
but no one could tell us where Sheikh
Tahar was. So we have come home
again."</p>

<p>A few months after this Karim bade
good-bye to his friends at the palace, and
went back to his home to prepare for his
wedding. The agha sent him a fine piece
of Persian shawl, and a handsome present
of money, and the mirza and Nasr'ulla
gave him a farewell dinner. He had
an equally pleasant welcome when he
reached his father's house the next evening,
for everyone was delighted to see
him.</p>

<p>Here soon all were active in preparing
for the wedding. Kadija busied herself
with embroidering nearly twenty small
caps, and knitting over a dozen pairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
red and yellow socks, which were to be
given to Karim's friends. Abdullah and
Nana made a trip to the city with the
parents and uncle of Kadija to buy her
wedding dresses. Since Karim paid for
them Kadija's parents spent just as much
money as Abdullah allowed, and of course
he did not like to object at such a time.
They bought a skirt of bright green silk,
another of yellow satin, and three of
bright coloured calico, with one jacket
made of Persian shawl, and another of
Damascus silk.</p>

<p>Karim accompanied his parents to the
city, and went to the palace to call upon
the mirza. He was surprised to find the
court yard full of Kurds. The mirza was
very glad to see him, but could not entertain
him long.</p>

<p>"Come again another day," he said,
"and I will invite our friends in to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
some tea with you. Just now we are busy
entertaining your old friend Sheikh Tahar."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Karim in astonishment.
"I thought that the governor
had sworn that he would never rest until
the sheikh was brought to him in chains."</p>

<p>"So he has," replied the mirza, "and
you remember how he sent up an army
to capture him, and how the sheikh escaped
only by making himself so small
that no one could see him. But what can
the agha do? This Kurdish fox, when
he ran away from the agha's cannon, went
down to the city of Kerbella, and there
he made so many prayers at the grave
of the holy martyr Husain that the chief
mullah of Kerbella gave him a letter
which explained how holy a man he had
become, and how wrong it would be for
anyone to injure him. He came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with this letter, and what can one do?
All the mullahs and people would be
angry if the governor did not respect it.
The ruler of the province has telegraphed
that the sheikh is pardoned for what he
did, and now the agha is giving him a
great dinner, and I must be off to write
an order making him the governor of six
villages, including the one he robbed.
And a gold star is being sent to him by
the Shah, and a title, 'The Sword of the
Kingdom.' Our agha hopes that this will
keep him from giving more trouble.
Gold stars to pin on one's breast are
cheaper than fighting. The ammunition
the soldiers wasted on that empty house
cost the price of fifty stars and twenty
dinners."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>FAREWELL TO KARIM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the time for Karim's wedding approached,
the man who studied the skies
was asked by Abdullah to find out what
day would be the best for the wedding.</p>

<p>"The stars show me," he said, "that it
must not occur upon the first day or upon
the middle day of the month, or for three
days after the full moon. These days will
be sure to bring bad luck."</p>

<p>The mullah then went to the house of
Shahbaz. Kadija stood behind a curtain,
so that he could not see her&mdash;for that
was the custom. He read some verses
from the Koran, and then made a prayer.
After this he asked,</p>

<p>"Kadija, daughter of Shahbaz, are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
willing to marry Karim, the son of Abdullah?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered from behind the
curtain.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the mullah, "since
you yourself say that you are willing, no
one can now object." And he thrust a
paper, stating this, under the curtain.</p>

<p>The wedding celebration lasted three
days, and was held in Abdullah's house.
There was plenty to eat, and plenty of
music, made by a fife and drum for the
boys and young men to dance by in the
yard; the girls and women danced inside
the house. Everybody in the village came
to congratulate Abdullah, and to take dinner.
From all the villages near by the
beggars swarmed outside in the dust of
the street; they, too, were given something
to eat.</p>

<p>On the last day Karim's friends came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
on horseback to Shahbaz' house to take
away the bride to the house of Abdullah.
Each carried a chicken as a present. Her
mother threw a thick red veil over Kadija,
so that no one could see her, and
they led her out and placed her upon a
horse. Then the procession started, a man
walking on either side of Kadija to keep
her from falling, while another led the
horse. The crowd began to shout and yell,
and to fire off guns and pistols.</p>

<img src="images/i0196.jpg" width="356" height="500" alt="photograph of man and woman" />
<div class="caption">KARIM AND HIS BRIDE.</div>
</div>

<p>The noisy procession first went to the
house of the mullah, who scattered raisins
for good luck over Kadija's head. Then
they passed on to the house of a khan,
the agha's tax collector, who happened
to be in the village. He threw copper
shahis into the street, and laughed heartily
at the boys when they fell over each
other trying to pick them up.</p>

<p>And so at last they reached Abdullah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
house, where Karim, standing upon the
roof, tried to hit his bride with three red
apples, which he threw while the crowd
cheered.</p>

<p>Lastly the men took Kadija from the
horse and she was led into the house.
This completed the ceremony. Here, for
the first time since they had become engaged
to be married, Karim spoke to his
bride.</p>
